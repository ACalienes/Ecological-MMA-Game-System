\# Ecological MMA Games System

A constraints-led, decision-state-based framework for training MMA.

This system organizes MMA learning around:  
\- \*\*Environmental constraints\*\* (space, wall, ground)  
\- \*\*Decision states\*\* (access → stabilize → exploit → counter)  
\- \*\*Games, not techniques\*\*  
\- \*\*Symmetric offense and defense\*\*  
\- \*\*Repeatable patterns across environments\*\*

This is not a technique library.  
It is a \*\*problem-solving system\*\*.

\#\# How to Use This System

1\. Start with \*\*System Overview\*\*  
2\. Learn the shared language in \*\*Vocabulary\*\*  
3\. Understand design rules in \*\*Principles\*\*  
4\. Navigate learning paths via the \*\*System Map\*\*  
5\. Build or modify games using \*\*Templates\*\*  
6\. Diagnose outcomes using the \*\*Coaching Toolkit\*\*

\#\# Design Philosophy

\- The environment teaches.  
\- Constraints create behavior.  
\- Control precedes damage.  
\- Every solution creates a counter.  
\- Systems evolve.

\#\# SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

This system reflects the current best understanding of ecological MMA training.  
All concepts, rules, and structures are subject to refinement as new insights emerge.
