\# System Overview

\#\# What This System Is

The Ecological MMA Games System is a \*\*decision-state framework\*\*.  
It teaches athletes how to solve recurring MMA problems under realistic constraints.

It intentionally avoids:  
\- static drilling  
\- technique memorization  
\- outcome-only sparring

\---

\#\# The Universal MMA Pattern

All MMA interactions cycle through:

1\. \*\*Access\*\* – Can I engage or connect?  
2\. \*\*Stabilize\*\* – Can I prevent escape or reversal?  
3\. \*\*Exploit\*\* – Can I strike, submit, or advance?  
4\. \*\*Counter\*\* – Can the opponent interrupt, escape, or reverse?

Games isolate \*\*one primary decision state at a time\*\*.

\#\# Environmental Layers

\- Open Space  
\- Wall  
\- Ground

A change in dominant environment usually requires a \*\*new game\*\*.

\- Vocabulary → shared language  
\- Templates → consistency  
\- Games → application  
\- Maps → navigation  
\- Toolkit → diagnosis
