\# Safety & Intensity Rules

\#\# Non-Negotiable Principles

\#\#\# 1\. No Falling Bodyweight Onto Legs  
All takedowns must be created through off-balancing.

\#\#\# 2\. Control Precedes Gravity  
Opponents are guided, not dumped.

\#\#\# 3\. Strikes Are Informational  
Strikes shape decisions; they are not for damage accumulation.

\#\#\# 4\. Submissions Are Emergent  
No jumping guard, sitting to finish, or forced cranks.

\#\#\# 5\. Coach Intervention  
Stop play if posture, joints, or coordination degrade.
