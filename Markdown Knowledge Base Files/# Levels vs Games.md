\# Levels vs Games

\#\# Definitions

\- \*\*Game\*\*: distinct learning problem  
\- \*\*Level\*\*: increased completion inside same problem

\---

\#\# Create a New LEVEL When:  
\- environment unchanged  
\- decision unchanged  
\- difficulty increased

\#\#\# Example  
Wall Stand-Up:  
\- L1: stand  
\- L2: stand \+ disengage  
\- L3: stand \+ reverse

\---

\#\# Create a New GAME When:  
\- environment changes  
\- dominant constraint changes  
\- win condition changes

\---

\#\# Rule of Thumb

Change ≥2 of:  
\- environment  
\- entry  
\- win condition  
\- roles  
\- decision

→ New game.

\#\# SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

Design rules may evolve as edge cases emerge.
