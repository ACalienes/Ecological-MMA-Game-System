# Rear Leg Offense

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Developing offensive capability with the rear leg only
    - **Environment:** Skill Isolation
    - **Stage:** Access (Offensive Skill Development)

This is a **beginner offensive skill isolation game** that develops rear leg (power leg) offense. The attacker can ONLY use their rear leg, forcing them to find timing, setups, and entries for power kicks.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land clean strikes using rear leg only |
| **Defender** | Defend against rear leg attacks (defense only, no counter) |

The objective is **weapon development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position at kicking range
- Attacker can only use rear leg (rear round kick, rear teep, etc.)
- Defender uses any defensive solution but cannot counter
- Reset after clean strike lands or set time

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker uses **rear leg ONLY** — no hands, no lead leg
2. Defender can **defend only** — no counters at Level 1
3. Both players maintain appropriate range
4. Reset to neutral after each successful attack

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Find openings for power kicks
- Vary targets (head, body, legs)
- Develop entries and setups for the rear leg
- Manage distance for power generation

### Defender
- Defend all rear leg attacks
- Use appropriate defensive solutions (check, catch, evade)
- Provide realistic resistance

!!! question "Key Internal Questions — Attacker"
    - "Am I at the right range for power?"
    - "What setup can I use to land the rear kick?"
    - "Can I use feints to create openings?"

---

## Key Logic: Power Kick Development

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    The rear leg is the power kicking weapon but requires more setup. Within the constraint:

    - Rear round kick to leg (low kick)
    - Rear round kick to body
    - Rear round kick to head
    - Rear teep
    - Rear side kick
    - Feints to draw defensive reactions

    This develops the ability to land power kicks effectively.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Attacker** | Land a clean rear leg strike |
| **Defender** | No win condition — success is measured by quality of defense |

**On attacker win:** Roles switch — attacker becomes defender.

---

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Defense Only"
    - Attacker: Rear leg only
    - Defender: Defense only, no counters
    - Focus: Develop rear leg timing and entries

=== "Level 2 — Add Counter Threat"
    - Defender can throw counters after successful defense
    - Attacker must respect counter threat
    - Focus: Landing power kicks while managing risk

=== "Level 3 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Defender can counter-strike OR shoot/clinch
    - Attacker must land rear leg while respecting all threats
    - Focus: Power kick offense under MMA pressure
    - See: [Full MMA Expression](../concepts/full-mma-expression.md)

## Constraints Analysis

*How this game applies the [Constraints-Led Approach](../principles/cla/index.md)*

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Affordance Created |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Task** | Attacker uses rear leg only | Forces development of power kick entries and setups |
| **Task** | Defender cannot counter (Level 1) | Attacker can focus on setup and commitment |
| **Task** | No lead leg or hands | Must create openings without faster tools |
| **Task** | All rear leg kicks available | Invites discovery of round kick, teep, side kick options |
| **Individual** | Skill level matching | Appropriate challenge for development |
| **Environmental** | Kicking range maintained | Rear leg power is viable with proper setup |

!!! info "Theoretical Foundation"
    This game implements **Constrain to Afford** (Renshaw et al., 2019). By removing the lead leg and hands, the attacker must discover entries and setups for power kicks that would normally be hidden behind faster weapons. This develops the ability to land fight-changing kicks when the opportunity presents.

## Information Structure

*What athletes must perceive to succeed (perception-action coupling)*

### Attacker Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Defender's distance | Determining if in range for power kick |
| **Visual** | Defender's stance and weight distribution | Target selection and timing |
| **Visual** | Defender's defensive posture | Where openings exist |
| **Visual** | Defender's reaction to feints | What setups will work |
| **Proprioceptive** | Hip rotation and balance | Power generation |
| **Proprioceptive** | Range to target | Kick selection and commitment |

### Defender Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Attacker's hip chamber/weight shift | Early detection of power kick |
| **Visual** | Attacker's range closing | When attack is imminent |
| **Visual** | Kick trajectory | Defense selection (check, catch, evade) |
| **Haptic** | Impact quality | Confirming defense effectiveness |

!!! tip "Coaching Cue"
    Ask attackers: "How did you set that kick up?" This develops their understanding of entry-to-finish sequencing for power kicks.

---

## Representativeness

*How this game models real MMA situations*

### Real MMA Situation

Landing power kicks (leg kicks, body kicks, head kicks) in striking exchanges—the high-damage tools that require setup and timing.

### How This Game Represents It

| Element | Real MMA | This Game | Fidelity |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Weapon** | All strikes available | Rear leg only | Isolated |
| **Setup tools** | Hands, lead leg, feints | Feints, movement | Simplified |
| **Defense** | Full defense + counters | Defense only (Level 1) | Simplified |
| **Consequence** | Damage/knockdown | Role switch | Reduced |

### Simplifications & Justification

| Simplification | Why Acceptable |
|----------------|----------------|
| Rear leg only | Isolates power kick development specifically |
| No hands or lead leg | Forces discovery of alternative entries |
| No counters at Level 1 | Allows focus on commitment and setup |

!!! note "Transfer Expectation"
    Athletes who develop rear leg entries here transfer to [Land the Target](land-the-target.md) where all weapons integrate. The setup and timing skills transfer directly to combination offense involving kicks.

---

## Variability Guidelines

*Creating "repetition without repetition" (Bernstein, 1967)*

### Within-Level Variability

| Vary This | How | Maintains |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Defender** | Rotate training partners | Different defensive styles to solve |
| **Kick emphasis** | Low kick sessions, body kick sessions, head kick sessions | Complete rear leg development |
| **Distance** | Start closer, start further | Entry adaptability |
| **Tempo** | Single power shots, multiple attempts | Timing adaptability |
| **Intensity** | Light to moderate contact | Control calibration for power kicks |

### What NOT to Vary

| Keep Constant | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Rear leg only | Core constraint defining the game |
| No hands/lead leg | Forces rear leg entry development |
| Power kick intention | This is about landing power, not volume |

### Progressing Through Levels

| Signal to Progress | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Lands rear kicks without obvious telegraph | Entry skills developing |
| Uses feints and footwork to set up | Setup variety emerging |
| Lands against varied defenders | Transferable skill developing |

---

## Readiness Indicators

*When is the athlete ready to advance?*

### Ready for Next Level When

- [ ] Lands rear leg kicks without obvious telegraph
- [ ] Uses feints and distance control to create openings
- [ ] Varies targets (leg, body, head) with rear leg
- [ ] Maintains balance through power kicks
- [ ] Maintains composure under counter threat (Level 2)

### Ready to Exit Game (Move to Land the Target) When

- [ ] Level 2+ competence (handles counter threat)
- [ ] Rear leg entries are disguised and varied
- [ ] Expresses desire to add hands/lead leg
- [ ] Power kick success maintains across varied defenders

### Warning Signs (Not Ready to Progress)

| Sign | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Telegraphs kicks obviously | Setup underdeveloped | Practice disguised entries |
| Only throws leg kicks | Limited variety | Introduce body/head kick focus |
| Rushes to close distance | Setup incomplete | Emphasize patience and timing |
| Power without control | Contact management issue | Reduce intensity, focus on placement |

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — power kicks especially should be controlled
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if attacker uses non-rear-leg weapons
