# Slip the Straight

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Learning to evade straight punches using head movement
    - **Environment:** Open Space
    - **Stage:** Access (Defensive Skill Isolation)

This is a **beginner skill isolation game** that teaches the slipping defensive solution. The defender can ONLY slip (move head offline), forcing them to develop this specific evasion skill.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land straight punches (jab or cross) to defender's head |
| **Defender** | Slip (move head laterally offline) to evade punches |

The objective is **skill development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position
- Close quarters distance (striking range)
- Roles are assigned; switch after 4 minutes
- Reset to neutral after each exchange

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker throws **straight punches ONLY** (no hooks, uppercuts, or looping strikes)
2. Defender can **ONLY slip** — no blocking, ducking, or backing up continuously
3. Attacker allows reset between strikes (no continuous pressure at Level 1)
4. Head strikes only (slipping body shots is not the skill being developed)

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Land clean straight punches to the head
- Vary timing and which hand to challenge defender
- Incorporate feints at higher levels

### Defender
- Move head laterally (left or right) to make the punch miss
- Slip early — read the punch and move before it arrives
- Return to center after each slip

!!! question "Key Internal Questions"
    - "Am I moving my head early enough?"
    - "Is the punch actually missing, or am I getting grazed?"
    - "Am I resetting to center after each slip?"

---

## Key Logic: Why Isolate Slipping?

!!! note "Skill Isolation"
    Slipping is a fundamental evasion skill. By constraining the defender to slipping only:

    - Develops head movement timing and reflexes
    - Learns to read straight punches early
    - Builds habit of making punches miss rather than absorbing

### Slipping Mechanics

- **Slip** = Moving head laterally offline (left or right)
- Works for **straight punches only** (hooks require ducking)
- The punch should pass by your head, not graze it
- Small, efficient movements beat large, dramatic ones

### Why Slipping Only Works for Straights

| Punch Type | Slip Effectiveness |
|------------|-------------------|
| Jab | Yes — moves along centerline |
| Cross | Yes — moves along centerline |
| Hook | No — follows you laterally |
| Uppercut | No — comes from below |

!!! warning "Constraint Creates Skill"
    By limiting to straight punches, the defender can focus entirely on the slip mechanic without worrying about punch recognition.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Defender** | Successfully slip a punch cleanly (full miss) |
| **Attacker** | Land a clean punch to the head |

**On defender win:** Roles switch — defender becomes attacker.

**On attacker win:** Reset to neutral, same roles, attacker continues.

!!! tip "The Strategic Insight"
    You don't need to slip every punch. The defender can absorb strikes while reading the attacker's pattern and timing. When confidence is high, commit to the slip. This teaches:

    - **Pattern recognition** before commitment
    - **Slipping as opportunity**, not just survival
    - **Timing over volume** — one good slip beats ten bad ones

**Duration:** Play until natural stopping point or time limit. Role switches keep both players engaged.

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Single Punch, Fixed Tempo"
    - One straight punch at a time
    - 1-second reset between punches
    - No feints
    - Defender: slip only

=== "Level 2 — Variable Tempo"
    - Still single punches
    - No reset requirement — attacker varies timing
    - Defender must read rhythm

=== "Level 3 — Add Feints"
    - Attacker can feint before throwing
    - Defender must distinguish real from fake
    - Slipping a feint = wasted movement

=== "Level 4 — Two-Punch Combinations"
    - Attacker throws 2-punch combos (jab-cross)
    - Still straight punches only
    - Defender slips both punches

=== "Level 5 — Counter After Slip"
    - After successful slip, defender can throw one counter punch
    - Teaches slip as setup for offense

=== "Level 6 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Attacker can throw straights AND shoot or establish clinch
    - Attacker wins by: landing clean strike OR establishing meaningful clinch/connection
    - Defender must slip effectively AND deny grappling entry
    - Focus: Slipping while remaining aware of all threats

## Constraints Analysis

*How this game applies the [Constraints-Led Approach](../principles/cla/index.md)*

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Affordance Created |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Task** | Attacker throws straight punches only | Defender perceives slip-able attacks |
| **Task** | Defender can only slip (no blocking, ducking) | Forces exploration of head movement solutions |
| **Task** | Head strikes only | Clear target zone for both roles |
| **Task** | Reset between exchanges (Level 1) | Time to recenter and process |
| **Individual** | Skill level matching | Appropriate challenge zone |
| **Environmental** | Close striking range | Slipping is necessary and viable |

!!! info "Theoretical Foundation"
    This game implements **Constrain to Afford** (Renshaw et al., 2019). The constraint (slip only, straights only) creates a narrow affordance landscape where the defender must develop head movement timing. Different fighters will develop slightly different slip patterns based on individual constraints (height, reaction time, stance).

## Information Structure

*What athletes must perceive to succeed (perception-action coupling)*

### Defender Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Attacker's shoulder rotation | Early detection of punch initiation |
| **Visual** | Which hand is loading | Direction to slip (opposite side) |
| **Visual** | Punch trajectory toward head | Timing of slip execution |
| **Proprioceptive** | Head position relative to centerline | Confirming successful evasion |
| **Proprioceptive** | Balance during/after slip | Recovery to neutral position |

### Attacker Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Defender's head position | Target selection |
| **Visual** | Defender's slip timing patterns | When to throw to catch them |
| **Haptic** | Contact (or lack of) | Whether punch landed or missed |

!!! tip "Coaching Cue"
    Don't tell defenders which way to slip. Ask: "Did that miss completely, or did it graze you?" This develops their perception of what a successful slip feels like.

---

## Representativeness

*How this game models real MMA situations*

### Real MMA Situation

Evading straight punches (jabs, crosses) in open space exchanges—making punches miss to avoid damage and create counter opportunities.

### How This Game Represents It

| Element | Real MMA | This Game | Fidelity |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Attack type** | All punches possible | Straight punches only | Simplified |
| **Defense options** | All evasions available | Slipping only | Isolated |
| **Target zone** | Head and body | Head only | Simplified |
| **Consequence** | Damage accumulation | Role switch | Reduced |

### Simplifications & Justification

| Simplification | Why Acceptable |
|----------------|----------------|
| Straight punches only | Slipping only works for straights; constraint matches technique |
| Head strikes only | Slipping body shots isn't the skill being developed |
| No blocking allowed | Forces commitment to evasion over absorption |

!!! note "Transfer Expectation"
    Athletes who develop slipping here transfer to [Evade the Punch](evade-the-punch.md) where ducking and pulling are added. The timing and reading skills transfer directly.

---

## Variability Guidelines

*Creating "repetition without repetition" (Bernstein, 1967)*

### Within-Level Variability

| Vary This | How | Maintains |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Rotate training partners | Different speeds, timing, tells |
| **Hand emphasis** | Jab-heavy sessions, cross-heavy sessions | Bilateral slip development |
| **Tempo** | Fast days, slow days | Timing adaptability |
| **Intensity** | Light touch to moderate contact | Pressure calibration |
| **Distance** | Slightly closer, slightly further | Range adaptability |

### What NOT to Vary

| Keep Constant | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Straight punches only | Core constraint that makes slipping viable |
| Defender can only slip | The skill being isolated |
| Head targets only | Maintains focus on head movement |

### Progressing Through Levels

| Signal to Progress | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Slips are clean (full miss, not graze) | Timing is developing |
| Slips both jab and cross | Bilateral competence |
| Returns to center automatically | Recovery pattern established |

---

## Readiness Indicators

*When is the athlete ready to advance?*

### Ready for Next Level When

- [ ] 70%+ of slips result in clean miss (not graze)
- [ ] Slips both jab and cross effectively
- [ ] Slip timing is early (not reactive/late)
- [ ] Returns to center without being reminded
- [ ] Can verbalize what they're reading ("I see the shoulder")

### Ready to Exit Game (Move to Evade the Punch) When

- [ ] Level 4+ competence (slips combinations)
- [ ] Slipping is automatic, not deliberate
- [ ] Expresses desire to add ducking/pulling
- [ ] Slip success maintains across varied attackers

### Warning Signs (Not Ready to Progress)

| Sign | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Slips too late (gets grazed) | Reading not early enough | Slower tempo, emphasize shoulder tells |
| Only slips one direction | Unilateral development | Emphasize neglected side |
| Doesn't return to center | Pattern incomplete | Reset after every exchange, cue return |
| Slips become blocking | Constraint breaking | Reset and reframe the game |

## Advanced Expressions (Coach Context)

As athletes develop:

**For defenders:**
- Slips become automatic and efficient
- Counter opportunities are recognized instantly
- Head movement integrates with footwork

**For attackers:**
- Learn to read slipping patterns
- Develop timing to catch defenders mid-slip
- Understand feint effectiveness

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — punches should land if not slipped, but not full power
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, defender freezing, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if defender starts blocking instead of slipping
