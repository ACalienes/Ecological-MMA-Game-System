# Evasive Movement

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Avoiding engagement through movement and distance management
    - **Environment:** Open Space
    - **Stage:** Counter (Defensive Striking)

This is a **defensive striking game** focused on avoiding conflict through movement — "getting on your bike." Unlike Close-Range Defense which handles incoming strikes, this game is about preventing engagement entirely through superior footwork and ring generalship.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Evader** | Avoid engagement and maintain distance |
| **Pursuer** | Close distance and establish engagement |

The objective is **space creation and maintenance**, not defense within range.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start at medium range
- Pursuer attempts to close distance and engage
- Evader uses footwork, angles, and movement to avoid
- Reset when pursuer establishes range OR evader maintains distance for set time

---

## Invariants

1. Evader **must keep moving** — static defense doesn't count
2. Pursuer **actively closes** — not just walking forward
3. Evader cannot strike (at Level 1) — pure evasion
4. Ring/cage boundary forces decision points

---

## Task Focus

### Evader (Defender)
- Lateral movement and angles
- Distance management
- Ring awareness — don't get cornered
- Timing pivots and direction changes
- Energy conservation while moving

### Pursuer (Attacker)
- Cut off angles
- Pressure without overcommitting
- Herd toward boundary
- Recognize when evader is trapped
- Maintain composure through frustration

!!! question "Key Internal Questions — Evader"
    - "Where is the boundary behind me?"
    - "Can I angle off or do I need to circle?"
    - "Am I moving with purpose or just running?"

---

## Key Logic: Movement as Defense

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    Evasive Movement is a distinct defensive strategy from in-range defense:

    | Strategy | When to Use | Risk |
    |----------|-------------|------|
    | Close-Range Defense | Already in range, must deal with strikes | Taking damage |
    | Evasive Movement | Can maintain distance, avoid engagement | Getting cornered, gassing |

    The skill is knowing when to evade vs. when to engage — and executing movement efficiently.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Evader** | Maintain distance/avoid engagement for set duration |
| **Pursuer** | Establish striking range OR corner evader against boundary |

**On evader win:** Roles switch.
**On pursuer win:** Reset, same roles.

---

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Pure Movement"
    - Evader can only move — no strikes
    - Pursuer walks/jogs forward with pressure
    - Focus: Footwork fundamentals

=== "Level 2 — Add Feints"
    - Pursuer can feint to test reactions
    - Evader must read real vs. fake
    - Focus: Movement under pressure

=== "Level 3 — Evader Can Counter"
    - Evader can throw single counters while moving
    - Punishes pursuer overcommitment
    - Focus: Movement + counter integration

=== "Level 4 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Pursuer can shoot or clinch
    - Evader must manage all threats while moving
    - Focus: Evasion under MMA pressure

## Constraints Analysis

*How this game applies the [Constraints-Led Approach](../principles/cla/index.md)*

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Affordance Created |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Task** | Evader can only move (Level 1)—no strikes | Forces development of movement solutions |
| **Task** | Pursuer actively closes (not passive walking) | Creates real pressure to move efficiently |
| **Task** | Ring/cage boundary exists | Decision points and consequences for poor positioning |
| **Task** | Win by duration (evader) or cornering (pursuer) | Clear objectives for both roles |
| **Individual** | Prerequisite: Close-Range Defense | Has fallback skill if caught |
| **Environmental** | Bounded space with walls | Evasion must be purposeful, not endless running |

!!! info "Theoretical Foundation"
    This game develops **ring generalship**—the perception of spatial affordances. The boundary constraint prevents infinite retreat and forces economical movement. Pursuers learn to read escape routes and cut angles; evaders learn to perceive traps before they close. Both develop through the **dyadic system** interaction (Renshaw et al., 2019).

## Information Structure

*What athletes must perceive to succeed (perception-action coupling)*

### Evader Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Pursuer's angle of approach | Escape direction |
| **Visual** | Distance to boundary behind/beside | Movement options available |
| **Visual** | Pursuer's weight commitment | When to pivot, when to circle |
| **Visual** | Pursuer's cutting patterns | Predicting trap attempts |
| **Proprioceptive** | Own balance and foot position | Pivot and direction change execution |
| **Proprioceptive** | Fatigue level | Energy conservation decisions |

### Pursuer Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Evader's movement pattern | Angle to cut off |
| **Visual** | Distance from evader to boundary | When trap is possible |
| **Visual** | Evader's weight distribution | Direction they'll likely move |
| **Visual** | Evader's fatigue signs | When to increase pressure |

!!! tip "Coaching Cue"
    Ask evaders: "Where is your space? Where is the wall?" This develops spatial awareness—the foundation of ring generalship. Ask pursuers: "Where do you want them to go?" This develops cutting strategy.

## Representativeness

*How this game models real MMA situations*

### Real MMA Situation

Avoiding a pressure fighter who wants to engage while maintaining positioning and energy efficiency.

### How This Game Represents It

| Element | Real MMA | This Game | Fidelity |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Pressure type** | Strikes + clinch + takedown threats | Pursuit pressure only (L1-2) | Simplified |
| **Evasion tools** | Movement + strikes + clinch denial | Movement only (L1-2) | Isolated |
| **Spatial constraint** | Octagon/ring boundaries | Same | High |
| **Fatigue factor** | Real | Real | High |
| **Consequence** | Getting cornered leads to damage | Getting cornered = loss | Analogous |

### Simplifications & Justification

| Simplification | Why Acceptable |
|----------------|----------------|
| No strikes at Level 1 | Isolates movement skill; counters added at Level 3 |
| Pure pursuit (no feints initially) | Develops fundamental movement patterns first |
| Clear duration win | Provides structure; real fights are continuous |

!!! note "Transfer Expectation"
    Movement patterns developed here transfer directly to any situation requiring distance management. The spatial perception—knowing where walls are, reading pursuit angles—is identical to competition ring craft.

---

## Variability Guidelines

*Creating "repetition without repetition" (Bernstein, 1967)*

### Within-Level Variability

| Vary This | How | Maintains |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Pursuer style** | Aggressive cutting, patient herding | Multiple escape solutions |
| **Pursuer speed** | Walking pressure, jogging pressure | Tempo adaptability |
| **Duration** | 30-second rounds, 2-minute rounds | Energy management development |
| **Space size** | Full cage, half cage | Different movement requirements |
| **Starting position** | Center, near boundary | Varied initial problems |

### What NOT to Vary

| Keep Constant | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Movement only for evader (at appropriate level) | Core constraint defining the game |
| Active pursuit (not passive) | Maintains real pressure |
| Boundary existence | Essential spatial constraint |

### Progressing Through Levels

| Signal to Progress | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Consistently avoids cornering | Spatial awareness developing |
| Movement becomes economical (not frantic) | Efficiency improving |
| Uses angles, not just circles | Tactical movement emerging |

---

## Readiness Indicators

*When is the athlete ready to advance?*

### Ready for Next Level When

- [ ] Maintains distance for duration consistently
- [ ] Movement is economical (not gassing prematurely)
- [ ] Uses pivots and angles, not just circling
- [ ] Can verbalize: "I saw them cutting so I changed direction"
- [ ] Remains calm under pursuit pressure

### Ready to Exit Game When

- [ ] Level 3+ competence (integrates counters while moving)
- [ ] Spatial awareness is automatic
- [ ] Movement integrates with defensive toolkit from Close-Range Defense
- [ ] Ready to add pressure dynamics (Pressure to Clinch)

### Warning Signs (Not Ready to Progress)

| Sign | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Gets cornered frequently | Spatial awareness lacking | Smaller space, slower pursuit, more reps |
| Gasses quickly | Movement inefficient | Focus on economy, walking pace |
| Only circles one direction | Pattern too limited | Constrain: "Can only circle left this round" |
| Panics when near boundary | Spatial perception underdeveloped | Verbal cues, slow down game |

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light contact on any counters
- **Stop conditions:** Collisions with boundary, loss of composure
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if evader is truly stuck
