# Touch and Don't Get Touched

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Range awareness, timing, and first-contact literacy
    - **Environment:** Open Space (no boundaries)
    - **Stage:** Access (Pre-Space, Pre-Pressure)

This is the **foundational engagement game** in the system. It exists before space control, pressure, or clinch logic.

---

## Goal

This is a **mirrored game**.

Each player aims to:

- Touch the opponent
- Avoid being touched
- Deny or negate the opponent's ability to respond

The objective is **initiative management**, not damage accumulation.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in open space
- No wall, boundary, or circling requirement
- Neutral stance at a comfortable distance
- Reset to neutral distance after each resolved exchange

---

## Invariants

1. No sustained pressure
2. No forward crashing or collisions
3. No takedowns unless explicitly permitted by level
4. Each exchange resolves quickly and resets
5. The game remains exploratory, not competitive

---

## Task Focus

### Both Players

- Read distance honestly
- Coordinate eyes, feet, and hands
- Time entry and exit cleanly
- Maintain composure after contact
- Recover initiative immediately when touched

!!! question "Key Internal Questions"
    - "Am I actually in range?"
    - "Can I enter without being hit back?"
    - "If I get touched, can I respond immediately?"

---

## Legal Actions

- Light touches to head or torso
- Punches and kicks allowed
- Single strike or **maximum two-strike sequence**
- Probing jabs encouraged
- No flurries
- No prolonged clinch unless allowed by level

All contact is **touch/light only**.

---

## Counter-Touch Logic (Critical)

!!! warning "This is the core mechanic of the game"

If a player is touched:

- They are allowed **one immediate opportunity** to touch back
- The counter-touch must occur within the same exchange window
- No chasing once the moment has passed

**Exchange outcomes:**

| Outcome | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Clean touch without response | Advantage |
| Touch followed by immediate counter-touch | Neutral (1-for-1) |
| Getting touched without response | Lost exchange |

This logic rewards:

- Composure under contact
- Counter-striking awareness
- Recovery of initiative

---

## Win Conditions

This game is **diagnostic**, not score-driven.

Success is evaluated by:

- Frequency of clean touches
- Quality of counter-touches
- Reduced panic after contact
- Improved range accuracy and timing

---

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Hands Only"
    - Punches only
    - Focus on jab range and hand timing

=== "Level 2 — Hands + Kicks"
    - Kicks introduced
    - Teaches layered range awareness

=== "Level 3 — Counter Emphasis"
    - Counter-touch strongly emphasized
    - Poor entries are punished immediately

=== "Level 4 — Hand Control as Denial"
    - Hand fighting and hand control allowed
    - Brief two-on-one control permitted
    - Goal remains: touch and deny response

=== "Level 5 — Clinch as Denial"
    - Clinch entry allowed **only as an immediate response to touch**
    - Hands-connected clinch, level change, or leg connection counts as denial
    - Once denial is achieved, the exchange ends

=== "Level 6 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Takedown entry allowed as denial response (level change, shot)
    - If clinch is established, brief continuation permitted
    - Full MMA denial options: counter-touch, clinch, or takedown threat
    - Focus: Complete denial toolkit under MMA reality

## Constraints Analysis

*How this game applies the [Constraints-Led Approach](../principles/cla/index.md)*

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Affordance Created |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Task** | Touch contact only | Removes fear, invites exploration of range |
| **Task** | No sustained pressure/flurries | Each exchange resolves, allowing perception |
| **Task** | Counter-touch opportunity | Teaches response composure after being hit |
| **Task** | Maximum two-strike sequence | Prevents mindless volume, rewards precision |
| **Task** | Reset after each exchange | Time to process and recalibrate |
| **Individual** | Skill level matching | Appropriate challenge zone |
| **Environmental** | Open space, no boundaries | Pure range and timing without pressure dynamics |

!!! info "Theoretical Foundation"
    This game implements **Representative Learning Design** (Renshaw et al., 2019). The core perception-action requirement—touch without being touched—mirrors the fundamental striking problem in MMA. The simplified contact level allows athletes to explore timing and range without fear-driven responses obscuring the learning.

---

## Information Structure

*What athletes must perceive to succeed (perception-action coupling)*

### Both Players Perceive

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Distance to opponent | Determining if in range to touch |
| **Visual** | Opponent's weight distribution | Timing of entry or exit |
| **Visual** | Opponent's eye/hand movement | Attack initiation detection |
| **Visual** | Opponent's recovery after contact | Counter-touch timing |
| **Proprioceptive** | Own balance and range | Entry/exit execution |
| **Proprioceptive** | Position after being touched | Recovery and counter-response |
| **Haptic** | Contact (being touched) | Triggering counter-touch opportunity |

!!! tip "Coaching Cue"
    Ask: "Were you actually in range, or did you reach?" This develops honest range perception—the foundation for all striking.

---

## Representativeness

*How this game models real MMA situations*

### Real MMA Situation

Open-space striking exchanges where both fighters seek to land without being countered—the fundamental rhythm of striking in MMA.

### How This Game Represents It

| Element | Real MMA | This Game | Fidelity |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Contact** | Full power strikes | Touch/light contact | Simplified |
| **Pressure** | Sustained possible | No sustained pressure | Simplified |
| **Weapons** | All available | Scaled by level | Progressive |
| **Recovery** | Must recover under threat | Reset after exchange | Simplified |
| **Objective** | Damage + control | Touch + deny response | Analogous |

### Simplifications & Justification

| Simplification | Why Acceptable |
|----------------|----------------|
| Touch contact only | Allows exploration without fear responses |
| Reset after exchange | Time to perceive and process |
| No sustained pressure | Isolates single-exchange dynamics |

!!! note "Transfer Expectation"
    Athletes who develop range honesty and counter-touch composure here transfer to [Pressure to Clinch](pressure-to-clinch.md) where pressure and space control are added. The timing and initiative skills transfer directly.

---

## Variability Guidelines

*Creating "repetition without repetition" (Bernstein, 1967)*

### Within-Level Variability

| Vary This | How | Maintains |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Partner** | Rotate training partners | Different speeds, ranges, timing |
| **Stance** | Orthodox vs. southpaw matchups | Angle variability |
| **Emphasis** | Entry-focused rounds, counter-focused rounds | Skill breadth |
| **Tempo** | Fast-paced days, deliberate days | Timing adaptability |
| **Target area** | Head-only rounds, body-included rounds | Target perception |

### What NOT to Vary

| Keep Constant | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Touch contact only | Core safety constraint |
| No sustained pressure | Maintains exchange-based learning |
| Counter-touch opportunity | Core mechanic of the game |
| Quick resolution and reset | Allows processing time |

### Progressing Through Levels

| Signal to Progress | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Range is honest (not reaching) | Distance perception developing |
| Counter-touches happen naturally | Composure after contact improving |
| Initiative recovery is automatic | Exchange dynamics understood |

---

## Readiness Indicators

*When is the athlete ready to advance?*

### Ready for Next Level When

- [ ] Touches land cleanly (not reaching or lunging)
- [ ] Counter-touches occur naturally after being touched
- [ ] Composure maintained after contact
- [ ] Entry and exit are clean (not crashing)
- [ ] Can articulate range and timing decisions

### Ready to Exit Game (Move to Pressure to Clinch) When

- [ ] Level 3+ competence (counter emphasis internalized)
- [ ] Range honesty is automatic
- [ ] Initiative recovery is immediate
- [ ] Expresses desire to add pressure dynamics
- [ ] Maintains quality across varied partners

### Warning Signs (Not Ready to Progress)

| Sign | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Reaching/lunging to touch | Range perception lacking | Emphasize "wait for range" |
| Freezes after being touched | Composure underdeveloped | More practice at lower tempo |
| Crashes forward on entry | Exit not planned | Emphasize "in and out" |
| Chases after missed attempts | Exchange boundaries unclear | Reset and reinforce structure |

---

## Advanced Expressions (Coach Context)

As athletes advance, the meaning of "don't get touched" expands.

At higher skill levels, denying a response may include:

- Controlling or interfering with the opponent's hands
- Entering into clinch or level change
- Removing the opponent's ability to strike at all

These are treated as **solutions**, not objectives.

!!! note "Core Problem Never Changes"
    - Initiate contact
    - Deny effective response

    Clinching is not rewarded by default. It is rewarded **only insofar as it prevents a counter-touch**.

---

## Safety

- Touch contact only
- No forward collisions
- No chasing after missed strikes
- Coach may pause play if structure degrades

---

## System Position

This game precedes:

- Pressure to Clinch
- All pressure-based striking games
- All clinch recognition games

It builds the **perceptual and timing foundation** for the entire system.
