# Tight Block

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Learning to absorb strikes using a tight guard/shell
    - **Environment:** Open Space
    - **Stage:** Access (Defensive Skill Isolation)

This is a **beginner skill isolation game** that teaches the blocking defensive solution. The defender can ONLY block using a tight shell, forcing them to develop this foundational skill.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land punches (straights and hooks) to defender's head or body |
| **Defender** | Block punches using tight guard (shell up, elbows in, hands protecting head) |

The objective is **skill development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position
- Close quarters distance (striking range)
- Roles are assigned; defender earns role switch through successful defense
- Reset to neutral after each exchange

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker throws **straights and/or hooks** (scaled to level)
2. Defender can **ONLY block** — no parrying, dodging, or backing up continuously
3. Attacker allows reset between strikes (no continuous pressure at Level 1)

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Land clean punches to head or body
- Vary targets and punch types to challenge defender
- Scale difficulty based on defender success

### Defender
- Maintain tight guard position (hands to face, elbows protecting body)
- Absorb strikes on arms and gloves, not on exposed targets
- Reset to good position after each defensive sequence

!!! question "Key Internal Questions"
    - "Is my guard tight enough to protect my head?"
    - "Are my elbows covering my body?"
    - "Am I absorbing on my arms or getting hit clean?"

## Key Logic: Why Isolate Blocking?

!!! note "Skill Isolation"
    Blocking is the most fundamental defensive solution. By constraining the defender to blocking only:

    - Develops the habit of shelling up under pressure
    - Learns to absorb on arms/gloves rather than exposed targets
    - Builds composure when taking fire

### Blocking Mechanics

- **Tight guard** = Hands to face, elbows to body, chin tucked
- Works for **both** straights and hooks (unlike parrying or slipping)
- Trade-off: Maximum protection, but no counter opportunity and hands are occupied

### Why Blocking Differs from Parrying

| Aspect | Blocking | Parrying |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Strike types | Straights AND hooks | Straights only |
| Movement | Static/absorbing | Active/redirecting |
| Energy | Absorbs impact | Deflects impact |
| Counter setup | Minimal | Creates opening |

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Defender** | Absorb the attack sequence on guard (no clean contact to exposed targets) |
| **Attacker** | Land a clean strike to head or body (not absorbed on arms/gloves) |

**On defender win:** Roles switch — defender becomes attacker.

**On attacker win:** Reset to neutral, same roles, attacker continues.

The defender must **earn** the offensive position by proving they can block effectively.

!!! tip "The Strategic Insight"
    You don't need to perfectly block every strike. You can take some contact while reading the attacker's rhythm and adjusting your guard. When you successfully absorb a complete attack sequence without getting hit clean — that's the skill demonstration.

    At higher levels (combinations), this means surviving the entire combination on your guard. One clean defensive success earns the role switch.

**Duration:** Play until natural stopping point or time limit. Role switches keep both players engaged.

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Single Punches, Straights Only"
    - One straight punch at a time
    - 1-second reset between punches
    - Defender: tight block only

=== "Level 2 — Add Hooks"
    - Attacker can throw straights OR hooks
    - Defender adjusts guard for different angles
    - Focus: Covering multiple attack lines

=== "Level 3 — Variable Tempo"
    - Attacker varies timing between strikes
    - No fixed reset requirement
    - Defender must stay ready

=== "Level 4 — Combinations"
    - Attacker throws 2-4 punch combinations
    - Mix of straights and hooks
    - Defender absorbs full combinations on guard
    - Focus: Maintaining structure through sustained pressure

=== "Level 5 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Attacker throws combinations AND can shoot or establish clinch
    - Attacker wins by: landing clean strike OR establishing meaningful clinch/connection
    - Defender must block effectively AND deny grappling entry
    - Focus: Blocking while remaining aware of all threats
    - This is the MMA reality: shelling up without posture creates takedown opportunities

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — punches should be felt but not damaging
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, guard breakdown, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if defender starts moving/dodging instead of blocking
