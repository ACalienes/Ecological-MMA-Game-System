# Evade the Punch

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Learning to evade different punch types using appropriate head movement
    - **Environment:** Open Space
    - **Stage:** Access (Defensive Skill Integration)

This is an **intermediate skill integration game** that teaches punch-type recognition and appropriate evasion selection. The defender must read whether a punch is straight or hooking and apply the correct evasive movement.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land punches (straights and hooks) to defender's head |
| **Defender** | Evade punches using appropriate head movement (slip straights, duck hooks) |

The objective is **skill integration** — matching the defensive solution to the attack.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position
- Close quarters distance (striking range)
- Roles are assigned; switch after 4 minutes
- Reset to neutral after each exchange

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker throws **straights and/or hooks** (scaled to level)
2. Defender can **ONLY evade** — no blocking, parrying, or backing up continuously
3. Attacker throws head strikes only
4. Attacker allows reset between strikes (no continuous pressure at Level 1)

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Land clean punches to the head
- Mix straight and hooking punches to force recognition
- Vary timing and rhythm

### Defender
- **Slip** straights (head moves laterally offline)
- **Duck/Bob** hooks (head moves down/under the arc)
- Read punch type early and select appropriate response

!!! question "Key Internal Questions"
    - "Am I reading the punch type early enough?"
    - "Am I using the right evasion for this punch?"
    - "Is the punch fully missing or grazing me?"

---

## Key Logic: Matching Evasion to Punch Type

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    Different punches require different evasive movements:

    | Punch Type | Evasion | Why |
    |------------|---------|-----|
    | Jab/Cross | **Slip** (lateral) | Straight punches travel down centerline |
    | Hook | **Duck/Bob** (vertical) | Hooks follow lateral head movement |

    Using the wrong evasion gets you hit.

### Slip vs. Duck

| Evasion | Movement | Works For | Fails Against |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Slip | Head moves left/right | Straights | Hooks (follows you) |
| Duck/Bob | Head moves down/under | Hooks | Uppercuts (meets you) |

!!! danger "The Recognition Challenge"
    The defender must read the punch early enough to select the correct evasion:

    - **Arm stays straight** → Slip
    - **Elbow bends, arm arcs** → Duck

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Defender** | Successfully evade a punch with correct technique (slip a straight OR duck a hook) |
| **Attacker** | Land a clean punch to the head |

**On defender win:** Roles switch — defender becomes attacker.

**On attacker win:** Reset to neutral, same roles, attacker continues.

!!! tip "The Strategic Insight"
    You don't need to evade every punch. The defender can absorb strikes while reading the attacker's patterns — identifying whether straights or hooks are coming. When confidence is high, commit to the correct evasion. This teaches:

    - **Punch recognition** before commitment
    - **Evasion selection** under pressure
    - **Timing over volume** — one correct evasion beats ten wrong ones

**Duration:** Play until natural stopping point or time limit. Role switches keep both players engaged.

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Predictable Pattern"
    - Attacker alternates: straight, hook, straight, hook
    - Defender knows what's coming
    - Focus: Correct evasion mechanics for each type

=== "Level 2 — Random Selection"
    - Attacker throws straights OR hooks randomly
    - Single punches, with reset between
    - Focus: Recognition and selection

=== "Level 3 — Variable Tempo"
    - Random punch selection
    - No fixed reset — attacker varies timing
    - Focus: Staying ready for either type

=== "Level 4 — Add Feints"
    - Attacker can feint before throwing
    - Feinting a jab then throwing a hook is now possible
    - Focus: Patience and commitment timing

=== "Level 5 — Two-Punch Combinations"
    - Attacker throws 2-punch combinations
    - May mix straights and hooks in same combo
    - Focus: Chaining evasions together

=== "Level 6 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Attacker can throw straights/hooks AND shoot or establish clinch
    - Attacker wins by: landing clean strike OR establishing meaningful clinch/connection
    - Defender must evade effectively AND deny grappling entry
    - Focus: Evasion while remaining aware of all threats

## Constraints Analysis

*How this game applies the [Constraints-Led Approach](../principles/cla/index.md)*

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Affordance Created |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Task** | Mixed punch types (straights and hooks) | Forces recognition and selection, not just reaction |
| **Task** | Defender can only evade (no blocking, parrying) | Explores evasion solutions without fallback options |
| **Task** | Progressive pattern complexity (predictable → random) | Scaffolded learning from mechanics to recognition |
| **Task** | Role switching on success | Both players develop attacking and defending skills |
| **Individual** | Prerequisite: Slip the Straight | Builds on existing straight-punch evasion skill |
| **Environmental** | Close striking range | Evasion timing must be precise (no distance buffer) |

!!! info "Theoretical Foundation"
    This game implements **Task Simplification** (Renshaw et al., 2019) by progressively adding complexity. Level 1's predictable pattern allows mechanical learning; later levels add the recognition challenge. The defender develops **degeneracy**—multiple evasion solutions that match different attack types—rather than a single response.

## Information Structure

*What athletes must perceive to succeed (perception-action coupling)*

### Defender Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Arm trajectory (straight vs. arcing) | Select slip vs. duck |
| **Visual** | Elbow position (extended vs. bent) | Early punch-type recognition |
| **Visual** | Shoulder rotation pattern | Timing of evasion |
| **Visual** | Attacker's weight shift | Anticipate which hand is coming |
| **Proprioceptive** | Own head position and balance | Execution of evasive movement |
| **Proprioceptive** | Recovery position after evasion | Readiness for next exchange |

### Attacker Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Defender's evasion pattern | Which punch type is most likely to land |
| **Visual** | Defender's head position | Available targets |
| **Haptic** | Contact (or miss) | Whether punch landed or was evaded |

!!! tip "Coaching Cue"
    Ask defenders: "What tells you it's a hook before it arrives?" This develops the perceptual distinction between straight and looping punches—the arm path, elbow bend, and shoulder rotation that differentiate them.

---

## Representativeness

*How this game models real MMA situations*

### Real MMA Situation

Defending against mixed striking in open space where both straight punches and hooks are threats requiring different evasive responses.

### How This Game Represents It

| Element | Real MMA | This Game | Fidelity |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Punch variety** | Full arsenal (straights, hooks, uppercuts, kicks) | Straights and hooks only | Simplified |
| **Evasion options** | All defensive solutions available | Evasion only (slip/duck) | Isolated |
| **Recognition demand** | Must read punch type quickly | Must read punch type quickly | High |
| **Consequence** | Damage accumulation | Role switch | Reduced |

### Simplifications & Justification

| Simplification | Why Acceptable |
|----------------|----------------|
| No kicks or uppercuts | Focuses on the slip/duck dichotomy which transfers to all evasion |
| No blocking allowed | Forces evasion skill development; blocking available in Close-Range Defense |
| Head strikes only | Isolates head movement skill; body defense integrated later |

!!! note "Transfer Expectation"
    Athletes who develop punch-type recognition here will transfer the skill to [Close-Range Defense](close-range-defense.md) where all defensive options become available. The perceptual skill—reading straight vs. hooking attacks—transfers to any striking context.

---

## Variability Guidelines

*Creating "repetition without repetition" (Bernstein, 1967)*

### Within-Level Variability

| Vary This | How | Maintains |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Rotate training partners | Different tells, timing, power |
| **Punch selection ratio** | More straights one session, more hooks another | Full evasion vocabulary |
| **Tempo** | Fast-paced rounds, deliberate rounds | Timing adaptability |
| **Stance matchup** | Orthodox vs. orthodox, orthodox vs. southpaw | Angle variety |
| **Lead vs. rear emphasis** | Focus on lead hooks, rear crosses | Complete punch recognition |

### What NOT to Vary

| Keep Constant | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Evasion only (no blocking) | Core constraint defining the game |
| Straights and hooks only | The punch types being learned |
| Head strikes only | Maintains skill isolation |

### Progressing Through Levels

| Signal to Progress | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Correct evasion selection 70%+ | Recognition developing |
| Smooth transitions between slip and duck | Motor patterns established |
| Calm under random selection | Ready for tempo variability |

---

## Readiness Indicators

*When is the athlete ready to advance?*

### Ready for Next Level When

- [ ] Correct evasion selection (slip for straights, duck for hooks) 70%+
- [ ] Can articulate the visual difference ("I saw the elbow bend")
- [ ] Evasion movements are smooth, not jerky or panicked
- [ ] Recovers to good position after each evasion
- [ ] Can handle both lead and rear punches

### Ready to Exit Game (Move to Close-Range Defense) When

- [ ] Level 4+ competence (handles feints appropriately)
- [ ] Punch-type recognition is automatic, not deliberate
- [ ] Expresses readiness to integrate other defensive solutions
- [ ] Evasion quality maintains across varied partners

### Warning Signs (Not Ready to Progress)

| Sign | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Uses same evasion for all punches | Recognition not developed | Slow down, emphasize punch-type differences |
| Freezes when uncertain | Still guessing, not reading | Return to predictable patterns (Level 1) |
| Only evades one punch type well | Incomplete skill set | Emphasize the weaker evasion |
| Gets hit by feints | Commitment timing off | Stay at current level, practice patience |

---

## Advanced Expressions (Coach Context)

As athletes develop:

**For defenders:**
- Punch recognition becomes instant and automatic
- Evasion selection happens without conscious thought
- Recovery between evasions becomes fluid

**For attackers:**
- Learn to disguise punch type longer
- Develop combinations that exploit evasion patterns
- Understand how to catch defenders between movements

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — punches should land if not evaded, but not full power
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, freezing, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if defender starts blocking instead of evading

!!! warning "Hook Caution"
    Hooks carry more rotational force. Attackers should throw at controlled speed until defender demonstrates recognition skill.
