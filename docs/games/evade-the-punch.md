# Evade the Punch

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Learning to evade different punch types using appropriate head movement
    - **Environment:** Open Space
    - **Stage:** Access (Defensive Skill Integration)

This is an **intermediate skill integration game** that teaches punch-type recognition and appropriate evasion selection. The defender must read whether a punch is straight or hooking and apply the correct evasive movement.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land punches (straights and hooks) to defender's head |
| **Defender** | Evade punches using appropriate head movement (slip straights, duck hooks) |

The objective is **skill integration** — matching the defensive solution to the attack.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position
- Close quarters distance (striking range)
- Roles are assigned; switch after 4 minutes
- Reset to neutral after each exchange

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker throws **straights and/or hooks** (scaled to level)
2. Defender can **ONLY evade** — no blocking, parrying, or backing up continuously
3. Attacker throws head strikes only
4. Attacker allows reset between strikes (no continuous pressure at Level 1)

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Land clean punches to the head
- Mix straight and hooking punches to force recognition
- Vary timing and rhythm

### Defender
- **Slip** straights (head moves laterally offline)
- **Duck/Bob** hooks (head moves down/under the arc)
- Read punch type early and select appropriate response

!!! question "Key Internal Questions"
    - "Am I reading the punch type early enough?"
    - "Am I using the right evasion for this punch?"
    - "Is the punch fully missing or grazing me?"

---

## Key Logic: Matching Evasion to Punch Type

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    Different punches require different evasive movements:

    | Punch Type | Evasion | Why |
    |------------|---------|-----|
    | Jab/Cross | **Slip** (lateral) | Straight punches travel down centerline |
    | Hook | **Duck/Bob** (vertical) | Hooks follow lateral head movement |

    Using the wrong evasion gets you hit.

### Slip vs. Duck

| Evasion | Movement | Works For | Fails Against |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Slip | Head moves left/right | Straights | Hooks (follows you) |
| Duck/Bob | Head moves down/under | Hooks | Uppercuts (meets you) |

!!! danger "The Recognition Challenge"
    The defender must read the punch early enough to select the correct evasion:

    - **Arm stays straight** → Slip
    - **Elbow bends, arm arcs** → Duck

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Defender** | Successfully evade a punch with correct technique (slip a straight OR duck a hook) |
| **Attacker** | Land a clean punch to the head |

**On defender win:** Roles switch — defender becomes attacker.

**On attacker win:** Reset to neutral, same roles, attacker continues.

!!! tip "The Strategic Insight"
    You don't need to evade every punch. The defender can absorb strikes while reading the attacker's patterns — identifying whether straights or hooks are coming. When confidence is high, commit to the correct evasion. This teaches:

    - **Punch recognition** before commitment
    - **Evasion selection** under pressure
    - **Timing over volume** — one correct evasion beats ten wrong ones

**Duration:** Play until natural stopping point or time limit. Role switches keep both players engaged.

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Predictable Pattern"
    - Attacker alternates: straight, hook, straight, hook
    - Defender knows what's coming
    - Focus: Correct evasion mechanics for each type

=== "Level 2 — Random Selection"
    - Attacker throws straights OR hooks randomly
    - Single punches, with reset between
    - Focus: Recognition and selection

=== "Level 3 — Variable Tempo"
    - Random punch selection
    - No fixed reset — attacker varies timing
    - Focus: Staying ready for either type

=== "Level 4 — Add Feints"
    - Attacker can feint before throwing
    - Feinting a jab then throwing a hook is now possible
    - Focus: Patience and commitment timing

=== "Level 5 — Two-Punch Combinations"
    - Attacker throws 2-punch combinations
    - May mix straights and hooks in same combo
    - Focus: Chaining evasions together

## Advanced Expressions (Coach Context)

As athletes develop:

**For defenders:**
- Punch recognition becomes instant and automatic
- Evasion selection happens without conscious thought
- Recovery between evasions becomes fluid

**For attackers:**
- Learn to disguise punch type longer
- Develop combinations that exploit evasion patterns
- Understand how to catch defenders between movements

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — punches should land if not evaded, but not full power
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, freezing, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if defender starts blocking instead of evading

!!! warning "Hook Caution"
    Hooks carry more rotational force. Attackers should throw at controlled speed until defender demonstrates recognition skill.
