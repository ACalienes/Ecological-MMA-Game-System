# Rear Hand Offense

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Developing offensive capability with the rear hand only
    - **Environment:** Skill Isolation
    - **Stage:** Access (Offensive Skill Development)

This is a **beginner offensive skill isolation game** that develops rear hand (power hand) offense. The attacker can ONLY use their rear hand, forcing them to find timing, entries, and setups for power shots.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land clean strikes using rear hand only |
| **Defender** | Defend against rear hand attacks (defense only, no counter) |

The objective is **weapon development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position at striking range
- Attacker can only use rear hand (cross, rear hook, rear uppercut)
- Defender uses any defensive solution but cannot counter
- Reset after clean strike lands or set time

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker uses **rear hand ONLY** — no lead hand, no kicks
2. Defender can **defend only** — no counters at Level 1
3. Both players maintain striking range
4. Reset to neutral after each successful attack

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Find openings for power hand strikes
- Vary targets (head, body)
- Develop entries and setups for the rear hand
- Manage distance for power generation

### Defender
- Defend all rear hand attacks
- Use appropriate defensive solutions
- Provide realistic resistance

!!! question "Key Internal Questions — Attacker"
    - "Am I in range for power?"
    - "What setup can I use to land the rear hand?"
    - "Can I use feints or level changes to create openings?"

---

## Key Logic: Power Hand Development

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    The rear hand requires setup because it travels further and is easier to see. Within the constraint:

    - Cross to head
    - Cross to body
    - Rear hook
    - Rear uppercut
    - Feints to draw defensive reactions
    - Level changes to open targets

    This develops the ability to land power when you need it.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Attacker** | Land a clean rear hand strike |
| **Defender** | No win condition — success is measured by quality of defense |

**On attacker win:** Roles switch — attacker becomes defender.

---

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Defense Only"
    - Attacker: Rear hand only
    - Defender: Defense only, no counters
    - Focus: Develop rear hand timing and entries

=== "Level 2 — Add Counter Threat"
    - Defender can throw counters after successful defense
    - Attacker must respect counter threat
    - Focus: Landing power while managing risk

=== "Level 3 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Defender can counter-strike OR shoot/clinch
    - Attacker must land rear hand while respecting all threats
    - Focus: Power offense under MMA pressure
    - See: [Full MMA Expression](../concepts/full-mma-expression.md)

## Constraints Analysis

*How this game applies the [Constraints-Led Approach](../principles/cla/index.md)*

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Affordance Created |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Task** | Attacker uses rear hand only | Forces development of power shot entries and setups |
| **Task** | Defender cannot counter (Level 1) | Attacker can focus on setup development |
| **Task** | No lead hand available | Must create openings without jab setup |
| **Task** | All rear hand tools available | Invites discovery of cross, hook, uppercut options |
| **Individual** | Skill level matching | Appropriate challenge for development |
| **Environmental** | Striking range maintained | Rear hand is viable with proper entry |

!!! info "Theoretical Foundation"
    This game implements **Constrain to Afford** (Renshaw et al., 2019). By removing the lead hand, the attacker must discover entries and setups for power shots that would normally be hidden behind a jab. This develops the ability to land power when the opportunity presents—a critical MMA skill.

## Information Structure

*What athletes must perceive to succeed (perception-action coupling)*

### Attacker Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Defender's distance and stance | Determining if in range for power |
| **Visual** | Defender's defensive posture | Where openings exist |
| **Visual** | Defender's reaction to feints | What setups will work |
| **Visual** | Defender's hand position | Target selection |
| **Proprioceptive** | Weight transfer and rotation | Power generation |
| **Proprioceptive** | Range and balance | Strike selection and commitment |

### Defender Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Attacker's weight shift/hip rotation | Early detection of power shot |
| **Visual** | Attacker's range closing | When attack is likely |
| **Visual** | Feint vs. commitment tells | Distinguishing real from fake |
| **Haptic** | Impact quality | Confirming defense effectiveness |

!!! tip "Coaching Cue"
    Ask attackers: "How did you create that opening?" This develops their understanding of setup-to-finish sequencing for power shots.

---

## Representativeness

*How this game models real MMA situations*

### Real MMA Situation

Landing power punches (crosses, rear hooks, rear uppercuts) in standing exchanges—the fight-ending shots that require setup and timing.

### How This Game Represents It

| Element | Real MMA | This Game | Fidelity |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Weapon** | All strikes available | Rear hand only | Isolated |
| **Setup tools** | Jab, feints, movement | Feints, movement, level changes | Simplified |
| **Defense** | Full defense + counters | Defense only (Level 1) | Simplified |
| **Consequence** | Knockdown/damage | Role switch | Reduced |

### Simplifications & Justification

| Simplification | Why Acceptable |
|----------------|----------------|
| Rear hand only | Isolates power shot development specifically |
| No lead hand | Forces discovery of alternative entries |
| No counters at Level 1 | Allows focus on setup development |

!!! note "Transfer Expectation"
    Athletes who develop rear hand entries here transfer to [Land the Target](land-the-target.md) where all weapons integrate. The setup and timing skills transfer directly to combination offense.

---

## Variability Guidelines

*Creating "repetition without repetition" (Bernstein, 1967)*

### Within-Level Variability

| Vary This | How | Maintains |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Defender** | Rotate training partners | Different defensive styles to solve |
| **Emphasis** | Cross sessions, rear hook sessions, body sessions | Complete rear hand development |
| **Distance** | Start closer, start further | Entry adaptability |
| **Tempo** | Patient days, aggressive days | Timing adaptability |
| **Intensity** | Light to moderate contact | Control calibration for power shots |

### What NOT to Vary

| Keep Constant | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Rear hand only | Core constraint defining the game |
| No lead hand/kicks | Forces rear hand entry development |
| Power shot intention | This is about landing power, not volume |

### Progressing Through Levels

| Signal to Progress | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Lands rear hand without telegraph | Entry skills developing |
| Uses multiple setups (feints, level changes) | Setup variety emerging |
| Lands against varied defenders | Transferable skill developing |

---

## Readiness Indicators

*When is the athlete ready to advance?*

### Ready for Next Level When

- [ ] Lands rear hand strikes without obvious telegraph
- [ ] Uses feints and level changes to create openings
- [ ] Varies targets (head and body) with rear hand
- [ ] Manages distance to generate power
- [ ] Maintains composure under counter threat (Level 2)

### Ready to Exit Game (Move to Land the Target) When

- [ ] Level 2+ competence (handles counter threat)
- [ ] Rear hand entries are disguised and varied
- [ ] Expresses desire to add lead hand/kicks
- [ ] Power shot success maintains across varied defenders

### Warning Signs (Not Ready to Progress)

| Sign | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Loads up obviously | Telegraphing power | Practice disguised entries |
| Only throws cross | Limited variety | Introduce rear hook/uppercut focus |
| Rushes to close distance | Setup incomplete | Emphasize patience and timing |
| Power without control | Contact management issue | Reduce intensity, focus on placement |

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — power shots especially should be controlled
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if attacker uses non-rear-hand weapons
