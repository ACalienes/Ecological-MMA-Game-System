# Rear Hand Offense

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Developing offensive capability with the rear hand only
    - **Environment:** Skill Isolation
    - **Stage:** Access (Offensive Skill Development)

This is a **beginner offensive skill isolation game** that develops rear hand (power hand) offense. The attacker can ONLY use their rear hand, forcing them to find timing, entries, and setups for power shots.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land clean strikes using rear hand only |
| **Defender** | Defend against rear hand attacks (defense only, no counter) |

The objective is **weapon development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position at striking range
- Attacker can only use rear hand (cross, rear hook, rear uppercut)
- Defender uses any defensive solution but cannot counter
- Reset after clean strike lands or set time

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker uses **rear hand ONLY** — no lead hand, no kicks
2. Defender can **defend only** — no counters at Level 1
3. Both players maintain striking range
4. Reset to neutral after each successful attack

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Find openings for power hand strikes
- Vary targets (head, body)
- Develop entries and setups for the rear hand
- Manage distance for power generation

### Defender
- Defend all rear hand attacks
- Use appropriate defensive solutions
- Provide realistic resistance

!!! question "Key Internal Questions — Attacker"
    - "Am I in range for power?"
    - "What setup can I use to land the rear hand?"
    - "Can I use feints or level changes to create openings?"

---

## Key Logic: Power Hand Development

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    The rear hand requires setup because it travels further and is easier to see. Within the constraint:

    - Cross to head
    - Cross to body
    - Rear hook
    - Rear uppercut
    - Feints to draw defensive reactions
    - Level changes to open targets

    This develops the ability to land power when you need it.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Attacker** | Land a clean rear hand strike |
| **Defender** | No win condition — success is measured by quality of defense |

**On attacker win:** Roles switch — attacker becomes defender.

---

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Defense Only"
    - Attacker: Rear hand only
    - Defender: Defense only, no counters
    - Focus: Develop rear hand timing and entries

=== "Level 2 — Add Counter Threat"
    - Defender can throw counters after successful defense
    - Attacker must respect counter threat
    - Focus: Landing power while managing risk

=== "Level 3 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Defender can counter-strike OR shoot/clinch
    - Attacker must land rear hand while respecting all threats
    - Focus: Power offense under MMA pressure
    - See: [Full MMA Expression](../concepts/full-mma-expression.md)

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — power shots especially should be controlled
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if attacker uses non-rear-hand weapons

    This game may be refined as offensive skill isolation patterns emerge.
