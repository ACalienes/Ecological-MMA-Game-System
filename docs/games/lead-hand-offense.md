# Lead Hand Offense

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Developing offensive capability with the lead hand only
    - **Environment:** Skill Isolation
    - **Stage:** Access (Offensive Skill Development)

This is a **beginner offensive skill isolation game** that develops lead hand offense. The attacker can ONLY use their lead hand, forcing them to find variety, timing, and openings within that constraint.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land clean strikes using lead hand only |
| **Defender** | Defend against lead hand attacks (defense only, no counter) |

The objective is **weapon development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position at striking range
- Attacker can only use lead hand (jab, lead hook, lead uppercut)
- Defender uses any defensive solution but cannot counter
- Reset after clean strike lands or set time

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker uses **lead hand ONLY** — no rear hand, no kicks
2. Defender can **defend only** — no counters at Level 1
3. Both players maintain striking range
4. Reset to neutral after each successful attack

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Find openings using only the lead hand
- Vary targets (head, body)
- Vary timing (feint, double up, change rhythm)
- Create opportunities through movement and misdirection

### Defender
- Defend all lead hand attacks
- Use appropriate defensive solutions (parry, slip, block)
- Provide realistic resistance

!!! question "Key Internal Questions — Attacker"
    - "What openings exist right now?"
    - "Can I create an opening with a feint or level change?"
    - "Am I varying my timing enough?"

---

## Key Logic: Variety Within Constraint

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    The lead hand isn't just a jab. Within the lead hand constraint, you can:

    - Jab to head
    - Jab to body
    - Lead hook
    - Lead uppercut
    - Feint any of the above
    - Double or triple up
    - Change timing and rhythm

    The constraint forces creativity within limited tools.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Attacker** | Land a clean lead hand strike |
| **Defender** | No win condition — success is measured by quality of defense |

**On attacker win:** Roles switch — attacker becomes defender.

---

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Defense Only"
    - Attacker: Lead hand only
    - Defender: Defense only, no counters
    - Focus: Develop lead hand timing and variety

=== "Level 2 — Add Counter Threat"
    - Defender can throw counters after successful defense
    - Attacker must respect counter threat
    - Focus: Landing lead hand while managing risk

=== "Level 3 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Defender can counter-strike OR shoot/clinch
    - Attacker must land lead hand while respecting all threats
    - Focus: Lead hand offense under MMA pressure
    - See: [Full MMA Expression](../concepts/full-mma-expression.md)

## Constraints Analysis

*How this game applies the [Constraints-Led Approach](../principles/cla/index.md)*

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Affordance Created |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Task** | Attacker uses lead hand only | Forces exploration of lead hand variety |
| **Task** | Defender cannot counter (Level 1) | Attacker can focus on offense without defensive concern |
| **Task** | All lead hand tools available | Invites discovery of jab, hook, uppercut options |
| **Task** | Target variation allowed | Encourages level changes and misdirection |
| **Individual** | Skill level matching | Appropriate challenge for development |
| **Environmental** | Striking range maintained | Lead hand is viable and necessary |

!!! info "Theoretical Foundation"
    This game implements **Constrain to Afford** (Renshaw et al., 2019). By limiting the attacker to lead hand only, the environment invites exploration of variety within constraint. Different fighters will develop different lead hand preferences based on individual constraints (reach, speed, stance).

## Information Structure

*What athletes must perceive to succeed (perception-action coupling)*

### Attacker Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Defender's guard position | Target selection (high or body) |
| **Visual** | Defender's weight distribution | Timing of attack |
| **Visual** | Gaps in defensive structure | Where to land the strike |
| **Visual** | Defender's reaction patterns | When to feint vs. commit |
| **Proprioceptive** | Own balance and range | Strike selection and power generation |
| **Haptic** | Contact quality | Whether strike landed clean |

### Defender Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Attacker's shoulder loading | Anticipating lead hand launch |
| **Visual** | Attacker's eye/head movement | Detecting target selection |
| **Visual** | Feint patterns | Distinguishing real from fake |
| **Haptic** | Contact location | Confirming defense effectiveness |

!!! tip "Coaching Cue"
    Ask attackers: "What opening did you see?" This develops their perception of defensive gaps rather than throwing blindly.

## Representativeness

*How this game models real MMA situations*

### Real MMA Situation

Using the lead hand to establish range, set up combinations, and find openings—the most frequently used tool in striking.

### How This Game Represents It

| Element | Real MMA | This Game | Fidelity |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Weapon** | All strikes available | Lead hand only | Isolated |
| **Defense** | Full defense + counters | Defense only (Level 1) | Simplified |
| **Targets** | All targets | All targets | Full |
| **Consequence** | Damage/advantage | Role switch | Reduced |

### Simplifications & Justification

| Simplification | Why Acceptable |
|----------------|----------------|
| Lead hand only | Isolates the most frequently used offensive tool |
| No counters at Level 1 | Allows focus on offensive development without defensive distraction |
| No rear hand or kicks | Creates necessity for lead hand creativity |

!!! note "Transfer Expectation"
    Athletes who develop lead hand proficiency here transfer to [Land the Target](land-the-target.md) where all weapons integrate. The timing and target selection skills transfer directly.

---

## Variability Guidelines

*Creating "repetition without repetition" (Bernstein, 1967)*

### Within-Level Variability

| Vary This | How | Maintains |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Defender** | Rotate training partners | Different defensive styles to solve |
| **Emphasis** | Jab sessions, hook sessions, body sessions | Complete lead hand development |
| **Distance** | Slightly longer, slightly closer | Range adaptability |
| **Tempo** | Fast days, slow days | Timing adaptability |
| **Intensity** | Light touch to moderate contact | Pressure calibration |

### What NOT to Vary

| Keep Constant | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Lead hand only | Core constraint defining the game |
| No rear hand/kicks | Forces lead hand creativity |
| Striking range | Maintains lead hand viability |

### Progressing Through Levels

| Signal to Progress | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Varies targets (head and body) | Target selection developing |
| Uses multiple lead hand tools | Weapon variety emerging |
| Lands against varied defenders | Transferable skill developing |

---

## Readiness Indicators

*When is the athlete ready to advance?*

### Ready for Next Level When

- [ ] Lands lead hand strikes consistently (50%+ success)
- [ ] Uses at least 3 different lead hand tools (jab, hook, uppercut)
- [ ] Varies targets without prompting
- [ ] Creates openings through feints or timing
- [ ] Maintains composure under counter threat (Level 2)

### Ready to Exit Game (Move to Land the Target) When

- [ ] Level 2+ competence (handles counter threat)
- [ ] Lead hand attacks set up naturally
- [ ] Expresses desire to add rear hand/kicks
- [ ] Lead hand success maintains across varied defenders

### Warning Signs (Not Ready to Progress)

| Sign | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Only throws jab | Limited variety | Introduce hook/uppercut constraints |
| Only targets head | Incomplete development | Body-focused rounds |
| Timing is predictable | Pattern locked | Emphasize rhythm variation |
| Freezes under counter threat | Not ready for Level 2 | More time at Level 1 |

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — strikes should land clean but controlled
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if attacker uses non-lead-hand weapons

    This game may be refined as offensive skill isolation patterns emerge.
