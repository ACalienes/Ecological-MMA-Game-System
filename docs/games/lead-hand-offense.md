# Lead Hand Offense

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Developing offensive capability with the lead hand only
    - **Environment:** Skill Isolation
    - **Stage:** Access (Offensive Skill Development)

This is a **beginner offensive skill isolation game** that develops lead hand offense. The attacker can ONLY use their lead hand, forcing them to find variety, timing, and openings within that constraint.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land clean strikes using lead hand only |
| **Defender** | Defend against lead hand attacks (defense only, no counter) |

The objective is **weapon development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position at striking range
- Attacker can only use lead hand (jab, lead hook, lead uppercut)
- Defender uses any defensive solution but cannot counter
- Reset after clean strike lands or set time

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker uses **lead hand ONLY** — no rear hand, no kicks
2. Defender can **defend only** — no counters at Level 1
3. Both players maintain striking range
4. Reset to neutral after each successful attack

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Find openings using only the lead hand
- Vary targets (head, body)
- Vary timing (feint, double up, change rhythm)
- Create opportunities through movement and misdirection

### Defender
- Defend all lead hand attacks
- Use appropriate defensive solutions (parry, slip, block)
- Provide realistic resistance

!!! question "Key Internal Questions — Attacker"
    - "What openings exist right now?"
    - "Can I create an opening with a feint or level change?"
    - "Am I varying my timing enough?"

---

## Key Logic: Variety Within Constraint

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    The lead hand isn't just a jab. Within the lead hand constraint, you can:

    - Jab to head
    - Jab to body
    - Lead hook
    - Lead uppercut
    - Feint any of the above
    - Double or triple up
    - Change timing and rhythm

    The constraint forces creativity within limited tools.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Attacker** | Land a clean lead hand strike |
| **Defender** | No win condition — success is measured by quality of defense |

**On attacker win:** Roles switch — attacker becomes defender.

---

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Defense Only"
    - Attacker: Lead hand only
    - Defender: Defense only, no counters
    - Focus: Develop lead hand timing and variety

=== "Level 2 — Add Counter Threat"
    - Defender can throw counters after successful defense
    - Attacker must respect counter threat
    - Focus: Landing lead hand while managing risk

=== "Level 3 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Defender can counter-strike OR shoot/clinch
    - Attacker must land lead hand while respecting all threats
    - Focus: Lead hand offense under MMA pressure
    - See: [Full MMA Expression](../concepts/full-mma-expression.md)

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — strikes should land clean but controlled
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if attacker uses non-lead-hand weapons

    This game may be refined as offensive skill isolation patterns emerge.
