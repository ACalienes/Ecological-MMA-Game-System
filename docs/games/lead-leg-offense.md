# Lead Leg Offense

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Developing offensive capability with the lead leg only
    - **Environment:** Skill Isolation
    - **Stage:** Access (Offensive Skill Development)

This is a **beginner offensive skill isolation game** that develops lead leg offense. The attacker can ONLY use their lead leg, forcing them to find range, timing, and variety with kicks from the front leg.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land clean strikes using lead leg only |
| **Defender** | Defend against lead leg attacks (defense only, no counter) |

The objective is **weapon development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position at kicking range
- Attacker can only use lead leg (teep, lead round kick, lead side kick, etc.)
- Defender uses any defensive solution but cannot counter
- Reset after clean strike lands or set time

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker uses **lead leg ONLY** — no hands, no rear leg
2. Defender can **defend only** — no counters at Level 1
3. Both players maintain appropriate range
4. Reset to neutral after each successful attack

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Find openings using only the lead leg
- Vary targets (head, body, legs)
- Vary kick types (teep, round kick, side kick)
- Manage distance for effective kicking

### Defender
- Defend all lead leg attacks
- Use appropriate defensive solutions (check, catch, evade)
- Provide realistic resistance

!!! question "Key Internal Questions — Attacker"
    - "Am I at the right range for this kick?"
    - "What opening exists for my lead leg?"
    - "Can I create openings with feints or level changes?"

---

## Key Logic: Lead Leg Versatility

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    The lead leg is the fastest kicking weapon. Within the constraint:

    - Teep to body (push kick)
    - Teep to face
    - Lead round kick to leg
    - Lead round kick to body
    - Lead round kick to head
    - Lead side kick
    - Feints with any of the above

    Develops quick, non-committal kicking offense.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Attacker** | Land a clean lead leg strike |
| **Defender** | No win condition — success is measured by quality of defense |

**On attacker win:** Roles switch — attacker becomes defender.

---

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Defense Only"
    - Attacker: Lead leg only
    - Defender: Defense only, no counters
    - Focus: Develop lead leg timing and range

=== "Level 2 — Add Counter Threat"
    - Defender can throw counters after successful defense
    - Attacker must respect counter threat
    - Focus: Landing kicks while managing risk

=== "Level 3 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Defender can counter-strike OR shoot/clinch
    - Attacker must land lead leg while respecting all threats
    - Focus: Lead leg offense under MMA pressure
    - See: [Full MMA Expression](../concepts/full-mma-expression.md)

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — controlled kicks
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure, excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if attacker uses non-lead-leg weapons

    This game may be refined as offensive skill isolation patterns emerge.
