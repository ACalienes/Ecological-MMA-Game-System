# Parry the Straight

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Learning to parry straight punches
    - **Environment:** Open Space
    - **Stage:** Access (Defensive Skill Isolation)

This is a **beginner skill isolation game** that teaches the parrying defensive solution. The defender can ONLY parry, forcing them to develop this specific skill.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Land straight punches (jab or cross) to defender's head or belly |
| **Defender** | Parry (deflect) punches using hands or forearms |

The objective is **skill development**, not competition.

---

## Entry Condition

- Both players start in neutral standing position
- Close quarters distance (striking range)
- Roles are assigned; switch after 4 minutes
- Reset to neutral after each exchange

---

## Invariants

1. Attacker throws **straight punches ONLY** (no hooks, uppercuts, or looping strikes)
2. Defender can **ONLY parry** — no blocking, dodging, or backing up continuously
3. Attacker allows reset between strikes (no continuous pressure at Level 1)

---

## Task Focus

### Attacker
- Land clean straight punches to head or body
- Vary targets (head vs belly) to challenge defender
- Incorporate feints at higher levels

### Defender
- Keep hands close to face as base position
- Tap straight punches to the left or right to redirect them
- Read the punch early — parry before it lands

!!! question "Key Internal Questions"
    - "Am I redirecting the punch or just getting hit?"
    - "Can I see the punch coming early enough to parry?"
    - "Am I resetting to a good defensive position after each parry?"

---

## Key Logic: Why Isolate Parrying?

!!! note "Skill Isolation"
    Parrying is one of four core defensive solutions. By constraining the defender to parrying only:

    - Develops timing and hand-eye coordination
    - Learns to read straight punches
    - Builds habit of redirecting rather than absorbing

### Parrying Mechanics

- You can only parry **straight strikes**, not looping strikes
- Less distance = harder to parry, easier to tight block
- Successful parry redirects the punch off your centerline

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Defender** | Successfully parry a punch cleanly (full deflection) |
| **Attacker** | Land a clean punch to the head or body |

**On defender win:** Roles switch — defender becomes attacker.

**On attacker win:** Reset to neutral, same roles, attacker continues.

!!! tip "The Strategic Insight"
    You don't need to parry every punch. The defender can absorb strikes while reading the attacker's pattern and timing. When confidence is high, commit to the parry. This teaches:

    - **Pattern recognition** before commitment
    - **Parrying as opportunity**, not just survival
    - **Timing over volume** — one good parry beats ten bad ones

**Duration:** Play until natural stopping point or time limit. Role switches keep both players engaged.

## Levels

=== "Level 1 — Single Punch, Fixed Tempo"
    - One straight punch at a time
    - 1-second reset between punches
    - No feints
    - Defender: parry only

=== "Level 2 — Variable Tempo"
    - Still single punches
    - No reset requirement — attacker varies timing
    - Defender must read rhythm

=== "Level 3 — Add Feints"
    - Attacker can feint before throwing
    - Defender must distinguish real from fake
    - Parrying a feint = wasted movement

=== "Level 4 — Two-Punch Combinations"
    - Attacker throws 2-punch combos (jab-cross, jab-body)
    - Still straight punches only

=== "Level 5 — Counter After Parry"
    - After successful parry, defender can throw one counter punch
    - Teaches parry as setup, not just survival

=== "Level 6 — Full MMA Expression"
    - Attacker can throw straights AND shoot or establish clinch
    - Attacker wins by: landing clean strike OR establishing meaningful clinch/connection
    - Defender must parry effectively AND deny grappling entry
    - Focus: Parrying while remaining aware of all threats

## Constraints Analysis

*How this game applies the [Constraints-Led Approach](../principles/cla/index.md)*

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Affordance Created |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Task** | Attacker throws straight punches only | Defender perceives parry-able attacks |
| **Task** | Defender can only parry (no blocking, dodging) | Forces exploration of parrying solutions |
| **Task** | Reset between exchanges (Level 1) | Time to process and recalibrate |
| **Task** | Role switching on success | Both players develop both skills |
| **Individual** | Skill level matching | Appropriate challenge zone |
| **Environmental** | Close striking range | Parrying is viable (vs. too far = no threat) |

!!! info "Theoretical Foundation"
    This game implements **Constrain to Afford** (Renshaw et al., 2019). The task constraints invite parrying behavior without prescribing how to parry. Different fighters will develop slightly different parrying solutions based on their individual constraints (reach, hand speed, reaction time).

## Information Structure

*What athletes must perceive to succeed (perception-action coupling)*

### Defender Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Attacker's shoulder rotation | Early detection of punch initiation |
| **Visual** | Punch trajectory (straight line toward face/body) | Direction of parry (left or right) |
| **Visual** | Attacker's eye gaze | Target prediction (head vs. body) |
| **Haptic** | Contact pressure on parrying hand | Confirmation of successful deflection |
| **Proprioceptive** | Own hand position relative to centerline | Readiness to parry |

### Attacker Perceives

| Information Source | What to Read | Action It Supports |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visual** | Defender's hand position | Where gaps exist |
| **Visual** | Defender's weight distribution | When they're off-balance |
| **Haptic** | Contact (or lack of) on punch | Whether punch landed or was parried |

!!! tip "Coaching Cue"
    Don't tell defenders *how* to parry. Ask: "What do you see before the punch arrives?" This develops their perception rather than prescribing movement.

---

## Representativeness

*How this game models real MMA situations*

### Real MMA Situation

Defending straight punches (jabs, crosses) in open space striking exchanges.

### How This Game Represents It

| Element | Real MMA | This Game | Fidelity |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Attack type** | Straight punches among many options | Straight punches only | Simplified |
| **Defense options** | All defensive solutions available | Parrying only | Isolated |
| **Opponent adaptation** | Continuous adjustment | Reset between exchanges | Simplified |
| **Consequence** | Damage accumulation | Role switch | Reduced |

### Simplifications & Justification

| Simplification | Why Acceptable |
|----------------|----------------|
| Straight punches only | Parrying only works for straight attacks; isolating this maintains action fidelity |
| No dodging allowed | Forces parrying development before integrating with other solutions |
| Reset between exchanges | Allows deliberate practice at coordination stage |

!!! note "Transfer Expectation"
    Athletes who develop parrying here will transfer the skill to [Close-Range Defense](close-range-defense.md) where all defensive options become available. The perception (reading straight punches) transfers directly.

## Variability Guidelines

*Creating "repetition without repetition" (Bernstein, 1967)*

### Within-Level Variability

To maintain the learning objective while avoiding robotic repetition:

| Vary This | How | Maintains |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Attacker** | Rotate training partners | Exposure to different timing, power, tells |
| **Tempo** | Fast days, slow days | Adaptability across speeds |
| **Target emphasis** | Sessions focused on head, others on body | Full parrying vocabulary |
| **Intensity** | Light touch to moderate contact | Realistic pressure calibration |
| **Duration** | 2-minute rounds, 4-minute rounds | Fatigue management |

### What NOT to Vary

| Keep Constant | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Straight punches only | Core constraint that defines the game |
| Defender can only parry | The skill being isolated |
| Clear win conditions | Maintains game structure |

### Progressing Through Levels

| Signal to Progress | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Consistent success (70%+) | Current level mastered |
| Multiple solution types | Not locked into one pattern |
| Automatic responses | Moved from deliberate to fluid |

---

## Readiness Indicators

*When is the athlete ready to advance?*

### Ready for Next Level When

- [ ] Success rate exceeds 70% against varied attackers
- [ ] Can parry both jab and cross consistently
- [ ] Parries appear automatic (not deliberate/hesitant)
- [ ] Recovers to good position after each parry
- [ ] Can verbalize what they're reading ("I see the shoulder move")

### Ready to Exit Game (Move to Close-Range Defense) When

- [ ] Level 4+ competence (handles combinations)
- [ ] Parrying integrated with posture and position
- [ ] Expresses desire to add other defensive tools
- [ ] Parry success maintains under varied attackers

### Warning Signs (Not Ready to Progress)

| Sign | Meaning | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| Only parries jab OR cross | Limited pattern | Emphasize the neglected punch |
| Success drops with new partners | Solution too narrow | More partner variety at current level |
| Reports "guessing" not "seeing" | Perception not developed | Slow down, use attention cues |
| Rigid/tense during exchanges | Still in coordination stage | Stay at current level, reduce pressure |

---

## Safety

- **Contact limits:** Light to moderate — punches should land if not parried, but not full power
- **Stop conditions:** Loss of composure or excessive force
- **Coach intervention:** Reset if defender starts blocking/dodging instead of parrying
