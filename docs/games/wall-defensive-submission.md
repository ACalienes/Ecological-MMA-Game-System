# Wall Defensive Submission

!!! info "Game Identity"
    - **Problem:** Using submissions to deter or reverse wall control
    - **Environment:** Wall
    - **Stage:** Counter (Defensive Grappling)

This is a **defensive grappling game** where the pinned player uses submission threats to deter control and create escape opportunities. Submissions from defensive wall position serve as both threat and escape tool.

---

## Goal

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **Defender (Pinned)** | Threaten or complete submission from defensive position |
| **Controller** | Maintain wall control while avoiding submission danger |

The objective is **submission as defensive weapon** — making control dangerous.

---

## Entry Condition

- Defender is pinned against wall
- Controller has established wall control
- Defender works submission threats
- Reset when submission achieved, defended, OR controller disengages

---

## Invariants

1. Defender must **threaten submissions** — not just escape
2. Controller **maintains intent to control** — not just defending
3. Submissions must be available from position (not fantasy techniques)
4. Wall position remains the environment

---

## Task Focus

### Defender (Pinned)
- Identify submission opportunities from position
- Threaten guilotine, front headlock, Kimura, etc.
- Use submission threat to create escape
- Finish if controller gives the opening

### Controller (Offensive)
- Maintain position while protecting neck/arms
- Recognize submission setups
- Choose: disengage or defend in place
- Keep head position safe

!!! question "Key Internal Questions — Defender"
    - "What submission is available from here?"
    - "Is their head position vulnerable?"
    - "Can I use this threat to escape even if I don't finish?"

---

## Key Logic: Submissions as Deterrent

!!! note "The Core Skill"
    Defensive wall submissions serve multiple purposes:

    | Purpose | How It Works |
    |---------|--------------|
    | **Deterrent** | Makes controller cautious, loosens control |
    | **Reversal setup** | Threat creates space to escape |
    | **Actual finish** | If controller doesn't respect, finish |

    Available submissions from wall defense:

    - **Guillotine** — Controller's head is low
    - **Front headlock/DNS** — Controller shoots or ducks
    - **Kimura** — Controller's arm is exposed
    - **Standing arm triangle** — Rare but possible

    The skill is recognizing when submission is available and using it appropriately.

---

## Win Conditions

| Role | Win Condition |
|------|---------------|
| **Defender** | Complete submission OR use threat to escape |
| **Controller** | Maintain control while defending submissions for set duration |

**On defender win:** Roles switch.
**On controller win:** Reset, same roles.
