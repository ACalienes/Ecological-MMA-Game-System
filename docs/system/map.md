## Fight States & Transitions

**The fight is cyclical.** You move between positions until someone finishes. Every path has a reverse.

## How the Diagram Works

**Read left to right:** Foundation skills → Open Space fighting → Transitions between positions → Positional fighting → Finish

**The cycle:**

1. Every fight starts in **Open Space** (standing at distance)
2. From Open Space, you can transition to **Wall** (clinch against cage) or **Ground** (horizontal grappling)
3. From Wall or Ground, you can **escape back** to Open Space
4. Any position can lead to a **finish** (KO, TKO, or Submission)

**Box colors show your role:**

- **🟢 Green** = Defensive — survive, escape, prevent transitions
- **🟠 Orange** = Offensive — attack, control, initiate transitions
- **🟣 Purple** = Combined — both roles active (scrambles, mixed situations)

## The Three End States

| End State | Definition | Primary Paths |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Knockout (KO)** | Single strike ends the fight | Clean strike with power and precision |
| **TKO** | Accumulated damage overwhelms defense | Sustained offense, wall grinding, ground control |
| **Submission** | Choke or joint lock forces tap | Ground control, defensive submissions |

!!! abstract "System Evolution Notice"
    Games can be added infinitely — the fight states and transitions are the structure, games are the teaching tools. See [Change Log](../reference/changelog.md) for version history.
