# Glossary

Key terminology used throughout the Ecological MMA Games System.

## Control States

### Pin
A control position where the defender's movement options are significantly limited by the attacker's body position and pressure. Distinct from TKO Pin.

### Top Control
Controlling position on the ground where the attacker is above the defender, managing hips and shoulders.

### TKO Pin
A **control state** (not just a position) where:

- Hips and shoulders are meaningfully controlled
- Posture and mobility are compromised
- At least one limb is free to strike effectively
- Defender options are high-cost

See: [TKO Pin Concept](../concepts/tko-pin.md)

### Scramble
A transition state where control is contested. Neither athlete has established position. Outcome depends on:

- Hip mobility
- Base recovery
- Positional awareness

### Disengagement
Successfully breaking contact and returning to a neutral position with defensive posture established.

---

## Decision States

### Access
The ability to connect or engage with an opponent. First phase of any exchange.

### Stabilize
Preventing escape or reversal after connection is made. Control establishment phase.

### Exploit
Executing damage (strikes), submissions, or positional advancement from a stable position.

### Counter
Interrupting, escaping, or reversing the opponent's attack. Defensive response phase.

---

## Submission Categories

### Defensive Neck Submissions (DNS)
Neck attacks (guillotines, front headlocks) used **defensively** to punish:

- Poor posture
- Over-committed control attempts
- Head position errors

DNS is allowed in most grappling games as a defensive tool, not as a primary objective.

## Design Concepts

### Representative Design
Training that mimics the decision-making context of competition. The environment creates the learning, not verbal instruction.

### Invariants
Fixed rules within a game that cannot be violated. They define the problem space and constrain behavior.

Example: "No clinching in open space" (Winning the Circle)

### Task Focus
The specific perceptual and motor challenges an athlete must solve within a game.

### Constraints
Environmental, task, or rule limitations that shape behavior. In ecological training, constraints replace instructions.

---

## Environmental Terms

### Open Space
Training area without structural constraints (walls, cages). Movement is unrestricted.

### Boundary
Edge of the training area (wall, cage, marked line) that limits retreat and triggers new behaviors.

### Wall Environment
Training context where the wall/cage is the dominant constraint. Changes available techniques and strategies.

### Ground Environment
Training context where both athletes are on the ground. Gravity and horizontal positioning become dominant.

---

## Game Structure Terms

### Game
A distinct learning problem with:

- Stable environment
- Clear goal
- Defined invariants
- Clear win conditions

### Level
A progression **inside the same game**:

- Same environment
- Same core problem
- Stricter or more complete success criteria

See: [Levels vs Games](../about/levels-vs-games.md)

### Entry Condition
The starting setup for a game — positions, distances, and reset rules.

### Win Condition
How success is determined for each role in a game.

---

## Safety Terms

### Informational Strikes
Light contact strikes used to measure distance, create reactions, or test control — not intended to cause damage.

### Controlled Descent
Bringing an opponent to the ground while maintaining connection and balance. Opposite of "dumping."

### Dumping
Using bodyweight or momentum to force an opponent down without proper control. Unsafe and penalized.
