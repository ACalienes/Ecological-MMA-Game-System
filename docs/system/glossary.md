# Glossary

Key terminology used throughout the Ecological MMA Games System.

---

## Control States

### Pin
A control position where the defender's movement options are significantly limited by the attacker's body position and pressure. Distinct from TKO Pin.

### Top Control
Controlling position on the ground where the attacker is above the defender, managing hips and shoulders.

### TKO Pin
A **control state** (not just a position) where:

- Hips and shoulders are meaningfully controlled
- Posture and mobility are compromised
- At least one limb is free to strike effectively
- Defender options are high-cost

See: [TKO Pin Concept](../concepts/tko-pin.md)

### Scramble
A transition state where control is contested. Neither athlete has established position. Outcome depends on:

- Hip mobility
- Base recovery
- Positional awareness

### Disengagement
Successfully breaking contact and returning to a neutral position with defensive posture established.

---

## Decision States

### Access
The ability to connect or engage with an opponent. First phase of any exchange.

### Stabilize
Preventing escape or reversal after connection is made. Control establishment phase.

### Exploit
Executing damage (strikes), submissions, or positional advancement from a stable position.

### Counter
Interrupting, escaping, or reversing the opponent's attack. Defensive response phase.

---

## Submission Categories

### Defensive Neck Submissions (DNS)
Neck attacks (guillotines, front headlocks) used **defensively** to punish:

- Poor posture
- Over-committed control attempts
- Head position errors

DNS is allowed in most grappling games as a defensive tool, not as a primary objective.

## Design Concepts

### Full MMA Expression
The highest level of any game where **cross-domain threats are added** while maintaining the game's core focus:

- Striking games add grappling threats (shoot, clinch)
- Wrestling games add striking threats

This ensures skills are tested under realistic MMA pressure without overwhelming beginners with complexity.

See: [Full MMA Expression Concept](../concepts/full-mma-expression.md)

### Representative Design
Training that mimics the decision-making context of competition. The environment creates the learning, not verbal instruction.

### Invariants
Fixed rules within a game that cannot be violated. They define the problem space and constrain behavior.

Example: "No clinching in open space" (Touch Game Level 1)

### Task Focus
The specific perceptual and motor challenges an athlete must solve within a game.

### Constraints
Environmental, task, or rule limitations that shape behavior. In ecological training, constraints replace instructions.

---

## Environmental Terms

### Open Space
Training area without structural constraints (walls, cages). Movement is unrestricted.

### Boundary
Edge of the training area (wall, cage, marked line) that limits retreat and triggers new behaviors.

### Wall Environment
Training context where the wall/cage is the dominant constraint. Changes available techniques and strategies.

### Ground Environment
Training context where both athletes are on the ground. Gravity and horizontal positioning become dominant.

---

## Game Structure Terms

### Game
A distinct learning problem with:

- Stable environment
- Clear goal
- Defined invariants
- Clear win conditions

### Level
A progression **inside the same game**:

- Same environment
- Same core problem
- Stricter or more complete success criteria

See: [Levels vs Games](../about/levels-vs-games.md)

### Entry Condition
The starting setup for a game — positions, distances, and reset rules.

### Win Condition
How success is determined for each role in a game.

---

## Safety Terms

### Informational Strikes
Light contact strikes used to measure distance, create reactions, or test control — not intended to cause damage.

### Controlled Descent
Bringing an opponent to the ground while maintaining connection and balance. Opposite of "dumping."

### Dumping
Using bodyweight or momentum to force an opponent down without proper control. Unsafe and penalized.

---

## Grappling Positions

### Guard
Bottom position with legs engaged between you and opponent. Allows defensive control and attack options.

### Half Guard
Bottom position with one of opponent's legs trapped between yours. Transitional position.

### Mount
Top position sitting on opponent's torso with knees on either side. Dominant striking and submission position.

### Side Control
Top position perpendicular to opponent, chest-to-chest. Strong control position.

### Back Control
Controlling opponent from behind, typically with hooks (feet inside thighs) and seatbelt grip.

### Turtle
Defensive all-fours position, protecting neck and limbs. Temporary survival position.

### North-South
Top position facing opposite direction from opponent, head-to-head.

---

## Striking Terms

### Jab
Lead hand straight punch. Primary range-finder and setup tool.

### Cross
Rear hand straight punch. Primary power punch.

### Hook
Curved punch targeting side of head or body.

### Uppercut
Upward punch targeting chin or body.

### Teep
Push kick / front kick. Used for distance management.

### Round Kick
Circular kick using shin as striking surface.

### Low Kick
Kick targeting opponent's legs (calf, thigh).

---

## Defensive Terms

### Parry
Redirecting a strike with a small hand movement.

### Slip
Moving head offline to avoid a straight punch.

### Roll
Rotating shoulders/head to deflect hooks.

### Sprawl
Hip defense against takedowns — driving hips back and down.

### Underhook
Arm positioned under opponent's armpit. Key control position in clinch.

### Overhook (Whizzer)
Arm positioned over opponent's arm. Counter to underhook.

### Frame
Using skeletal structure (forearms, elbows) to create space. Not strength-dependent.

---

## Training Formats

### Positional Sparring
Starting from a specific position with defined reset conditions. High repetition of specific scenarios.

### Flow Rolling
Cooperative, exploratory grappling at low intensity. Focus on movement, not winning.

### Live Sparring
Full resistance sparring with defined rules. Competitive intensity.

### Situational Drilling
Repeating specific scenarios with progressive resistance.

---

## Role Terms

### A Side
The athlete whose learning is prioritized in a game. Usually the "attacker" or initiator role.

### B Side
The athlete providing resistance/reactions. Still learning but in support of A Side's development.

### Feeder
Partner providing controlled stimulus (strikes, pressure) for specific skill development.

---

## System Terms

### Combined Game
A game where both athletes have simultaneous offensive and defensive objectives. Neither role is purely reactive.

### Transition
Movement between fight environments (Open Space → Wall, Open Space → Ground, etc.)

### Escape
Successfully disengaging from a controlled position and returning to a neutral or advantageous state.

### Pressure
Forward movement that reduces opponent's space and options. Can be striking or wrestling-based.

### Cage Cut
Using footwork and positioning to limit opponent's lateral movement options.
