## Primary Source

!!! quote "Core Text"
    **Renshaw, I., Davids, K., Newcombe, D., & Roberts, W. (2019).** *The Constraints-Led Approach: Principles for Sports Coaching and Practice Design.* Routledge.

This text provides the methodological framework for our entire system. The four Environment Design Principles (Session Intention, Constrain to Afford, Representative Learning Design, Repetition Without Repetition) directly shape how every game is structured.

## Foundational Theorists

### James J. Gibson (1904-1979)

**Contribution:** Ecological psychology, affordances, direct perception

**Key Work:**
- Gibson, J.J. (1979). *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception.* Houghton Mifflin.

**Core Ideas:**
- Affordances: The environment offers opportunities for action relative to an organism's capabilities
- Direct perception: Information specifies action possibilities without requiring cognitive mediation
- Perception-action coupling: Perceiving and acting form a continuous loop, not separate processes

**How We Use It:**
- Games are designed around affordances (what the environment invites)
- Athletes learn to perceive opportunities, not execute memorized techniques
- Training maintains the perception-action link (no isolated drilling)

### Nikolai Bernstein (1896-1966)

**Contribution:** Motor coordination, degrees of freedom, dexterity

**Key Work:**
- Bernstein, N.A. (1967). *The Co-ordination and Regulation of Movements.* Pergamon Press.

**Core Ideas:**
- Degrees of freedom problem: The body has enormous movement possibilities that must be organized
- Freezing → Releasing → Exploiting: Learners initially constrain movement, then progressively free it
- Dexterity: The ability to find motor solutions that are correct, quick, rational, and resourceful
- Repetition without repetition: Practice should repeat problem-solving, not identical movements

**How We Use It:**
- Games allow multiple solutions (building dexterity, not technique compliance)
- Levels progress from constrained to open (freezing → exploiting)
- Variability is built into practice (repetition without repetition)

### Scott Kelso (b. 1947)

**Contribution:** Coordination dynamics, self-organization, phase transitions

**Key Work:**
- Kelso, J.A.S. (1995). *Dynamic Patterns: The Self-Organization of Brain and Behavior.* MIT Press.

**Core Ideas:**
- Self-organization: Coordinated patterns emerge spontaneously under constraints
- Attractors: Stable coordination states that behavior tends toward
- Phase transitions: Shifts between coordination patterns when control parameters change
- Instability precedes change: Variability increases before new patterns emerge

**How We Use It:**
- Techniques emerge from constraints, not instruction
- Games create conditions for self-organization
- Productive instability (amber zone) is necessary for learning

---

### Karl Newell (b. 1945)

**Contribution:** Constraints model for motor development

**Key Work:**
- Newell, K.M. (1986). Constraints on the development of coordination. In M.G. Wade & H.T.A. Whiting (Eds.), *Motor Development in Children: Aspects of Coordination and Control* (pp. 341-360). Martinus Nijhoff.

**Core Ideas:**
- Three constraint categories: Individual (organismic), Task, Environmental
- Behavior emerges from constraint interaction (not any single factor)
- Constraint manipulation guides learning without prescribing movement

**How We Use It:**
- Every game manipulates specific constraints
- Rules (task constraints) shape what behaviors emerge
- Individual differences are respected (not one-size-fits-all)

### Michael Turvey (b. 1942)

**Contribution:** Action systems, ecological realism

**Key Works:**
- Turvey, M.T. (1990). Coordination. *American Psychologist, 45*(8), 938-953.
- Turvey, M.T., & Shaw, R.E. (1999). Ecological foundations of cognition. In R. Núñez & W.J. Freeman (Eds.), *Reclaiming Cognition* (pp. 95-110). Imprint Academic.

**Core Ideas:**
- Intra-individual coordination: Organizing body parts relative to each other
- Inter-individual coordination: Organizing body relative to environment/opponents
- Action systems are temporarily assembled, task-specific organizations

**How We Use It:**
- Games develop both types of coordination
- Combat sports require continuous inter-individual coordination (reading opponent)
- Synergies (movement solutions) are soft-assembled, not hardwired

## How This System Implements CLA

| CLA Principle | System Implementation |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **Constraints shape behavior** | Game rules (task constraints) create the learning environment |
| **Affordances invite action** | Scoring systems reward target behaviors without prescribing technique |
| **Self-organization** | Athletes discover solutions; coaches don't dictate movement |
| **Perception-action coupling** | Games include opponents and context; no isolated drilling |
| **Representative design** | Games model real MMA decision states |
| **Repetition without repetition** | Levels and variability guidelines ensure varied practice |
| **Individual differences** | Constraints can be adjusted for each athlete |
