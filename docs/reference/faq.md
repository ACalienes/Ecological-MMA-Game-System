Common questions and solutions for coaches using this system.

## General Questions

### What is the ecological approach?

The ecological approach to motor learning emphasizes:

- **Constraints-led training** — Use rules and boundaries to shape behavior
- **Representative design** — Training should mirror the demands of competition
- **Emergence** — Skills emerge from practice, not just instruction
- **Exploration** — Athletes discover solutions through guided play

Games in this system are designed to create learning conditions, not prescribe techniques.

### How is this different from traditional drilling?

| Traditional Drilling | Ecological Games |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Coach prescribes technique | Athlete discovers solutions |
| Repetition of fixed movements | Exploration of possibilities |
| Compliance-focused | Problem-solving focused |
| Isolated from context | Representative of real fighting |

### Do I need to teach technique separately?

Technique instruction can complement games, but:

- Games should come first — they create the "why"
- Technique emerges from game play
- Explicit instruction fills gaps, doesn't replace discovery
- Over-coaching can reduce learning

## Game-Specific Troubleshooting

### "Athletes aren't switching roles in asymmetric games"

**Problem:** One side is dominating; roles aren't switching.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check skill levels** — Mismatch may require intensity adjustment
2. **Review constraints** — Are invariants being followed?
3. **Adjust levels** — Drop to an easier level
4. **Coach one side** — Give the losing side tactical cues

### "Athletes are gaming the rules instead of developing skills"

**Problem:** Athletes find loopholes that win the game without developing the target skill.

**Solutions:**

1. **Address mindset** — Reference the Training Mindset principle
2. **Close the loophole** — Add or clarify invariants
3. **Change the game** — Some games may not suit all athletes
4. **Discuss with athlete** — They may not realize what they're doing

### "Athletes get frustrated when they can't 'win'"

**Problem:** Competitive mindset interfering with learning.

**Solutions:**

1. **Reframe success** — Success is learning, not winning
2. **Remove scorekeeping** — Some games work better without tracking
3. **Emphasize process** — Celebrate good attempts, not just results
4. **Reference principles** — The Training Mindset addresses this directly

### "Games feel chaotic or unstructured"

**Problem:** Athletes don't know what they're supposed to be doing.

**Solutions:**

1. **Clarify objectives** — Ensure everyone knows the goal
2. **Demonstrate** — Show what good play looks like
3. **Start simpler** — Drop to Level 1
4. **Check prerequisites** — Athletes may lack foundational skills

## Safety Questions

### How hard should contact be?

The system uses these contact levels:

| Level | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Touch** | Contact made but no force | Skill isolation, beginners |
| **Light** | Force felt but not damaging | Most development games |
| **Moderate** | Significant force, controlled | Advanced games, integration |

When in doubt, go lighter. Quality over intensity.

### When should I stop a game?

Stop immediately if:

- An athlete loses composure
- Contact becomes excessive
- Rules are being ignored
- An athlete appears hurt
- The learning environment breaks down

Reset, address the issue, then resume.

### How do I manage aggression?

Some athletes escalate intensity inappropriately:

1. **Set expectations clearly** — Before the game starts
2. **Match intensity** — Pair athletes of similar intensity preference
3. **Call resets** — Interrupt escalation early
4. **Address privately** — Discuss mindset after the session
5. **Adjust pairing** — Some athletes shouldn't work together

## Planning Questions

### How long should rounds be?

Suggested round lengths:

| Game Type | Round Length |
|-----------|--------------|
| Skill isolation | 2-4 minutes |
| Development games | 4-6 minutes |
| Combined games | 3-5 minutes |
| Integration | 5-10 minutes |

Shorter rounds with more resets often work better than long continuous play.

### How many games per session?

Quality over quantity:

- **Beginners:** 2-3 games, more time per game
- **Intermediate:** 3-4 games, balanced time
- **Advanced:** Can handle more variety

One well-developed skill beats five superficial exposures.

### What if I don't have the right equipment?

Adapt as needed:

| Ideal Equipment | Adaptation |
|-----------------|------------|
| Wall/cage | Marked boundary, padded wall, corner |
| Mats | Grass, carpet, reduced ground work |
| Gloves | Lighter contact, open-hand games |
| Boundary markers | Tape, cones, imaginary lines |

The constraints matter more than the equipment.

## Athlete Questions

### How do I know if I'm improving?

Look for:

- **Consistency** — Can you repeat successful actions?
- **Variety** — Do you have multiple solutions?
- **Composure** — Are you calmer under pressure?
- **Recognition** — Do you see opportunities earlier?
- **Transfer** — Does skill show up in sparring?

### What if I keep losing at a game?

Losing is learning:

1. **Analyze** — What specifically is going wrong?
2. **Ask** — Get feedback from partner or coach
3. **Simplify** — Drop to an easier level
4. **Focus** — Work on one thing at a time
5. **Persist** — Struggle is where growth happens

Reference: Training Mindset principle

### Should I always play to win?

No. Games are academic exercises:

- **Learning matters more than winning**
- **Honest play creates real feedback**
- **Struggle is valuable**
- **Your partner is your collaborator**
