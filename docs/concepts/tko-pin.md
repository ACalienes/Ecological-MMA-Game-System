# Concept: TKO Pin

!!! warning "Critical Concept"
    A TKO Pin is a **control state**, not a position.

---

## Definition

A TKO Pin exists when:

- [x] The defender's hips and shoulders are meaningfully controlled
- [x] Posture and mobility are compromised
- [x] **At least one limb is free to strike effectively**
- [x] Defender options are high-cost (damage, exposure, reversal risk)

    A[Control Position] --> B{Free limb to strike?}
    B -->|Yes| C[TKO Pin]
    B -->|No| D[Standard Pin]
    C --> E[Exploitation possible]

## Key Properties

### TKO Pin is Often Fleeting

Unlike a stable mount or back control, TKO pin is frequently a **momentary state** that must be:

- Created
- Captured
- Stabilized (if possible)
- Re-acquired when lost

### Trade-Off: Control vs Strike Access

!!! note "The Core Tension"
    To strike effectively, the attacker must release some control. This creates a trade-off:

    - **Maximum control** = Minimal strike access
    - **Maximum strike access** = Reduced control

    Skilled attackers learn to **oscillate** between these states.

### Exists on Wall or Ground

TKO pin can emerge in:

- Wall pin positions (Level 3)
- Ground control (from Wall → Ground transition)
- Stand-Up Loop (after successful re-pin)

## Quality Spectrum

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Threat** | TKO pin is available but not stabilized. Fleeting. |
| **Stable** | TKO pin is held for multiple seconds. Strikes landing. |
| **Dominant** | Defender has no viable escape. Fight-ending territory. |

## Training Focus

The system trains TKO pin through a progression:

    A[Create] --> B[Capture]
    B --> C[Stabilize]
    C --> D[Re-acquire]
    D --> A

    style A fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
    style B fill:#2196F3,color:#fff
    style C fill:#FF9800,color:#fff
    style D fill:#9C27B0,color:#fff
```

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Create** | Earn the position through control and transitions |
| **Capture** | Recognize when TKO pin is available |
| **Stabilize** | Maintain the state while striking |
| **Re-acquire** | Recover TKO pin after defender movement |

## Where TKO Pin Appears

| Game | How It Appears |
|------|----------------|
| [Wall Control](../games/wall-control.md) | Level 3 — Threaten TKO pin access |
| [Wall → Ground](../games/wall-to-ground.md) | Level 3 — Establish TKO pin threat |
| [Stand-Up Loop](../games/standup-loop.md) | Attacker win condition |

## Related Concept: DNS

Defensive Neck Submissions (DNS) are the primary defensive counter to TKO pin attempts.

When an attacker reaches for TKO pin and their posture breaks:

- Guillotine threats become available
- Front headlock entries open up
- Attacker must choose between TKO pin pursuit and neck safety

DNS keeps attackers honest. It is allowed in all games where TKO pin is relevant.

    TKO Pin definitions may evolve as control models refine.
