# Decision States

The four phases of any combat interaction, applicable across all environments.

## The Four States

Every moment in a fight falls into one of four decision states:

| State | Question | Goal |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Access** | "Can I get to them?" | Establish connection or position |
| **Stabilize** | "Can I hold this?" | Secure and control the position |
| **Exploit** | "Can I finish from here?" | Deal damage or submit |
| **Counter** | "Can I escape or reverse?" | Deny opponent's exploitation |

## Access

!!! info "The Entry Phase"
    **Question:** "Can I get to them?"

    **Goal:** Establish connection, close distance, or achieve position.

Access is about getting where you need to be. This could mean:

- Closing striking distance
- Establishing clinch
- Completing takedown
- Passing guard
- Achieving mount

**Games focused on Access:**
- Touch and Don't Get Touched
- Winning the Circle
- Boundary Trigger
- Ground Access

**Key Skills:**
- Distance management
- Timing entries
- Reading defensive reactions
- Feinting and setup

---

## Stabilize

!!! info "The Control Phase"
    **Question:** "Can I hold this?"

    **Goal:** Secure position and prevent escape.

Stabilize is about making your position stick. Without stabilization, access is temporary and exploitation is impossible.

- Establishing grips/hooks
- Killing hips
- Controlling posture
- Preventing frames

**Games focused on Stabilize:**
- Wall Control
- Ground Control
- Position maintenance in any game

**Key Skills:**
- Pressure distribution
- Anticipating escape attempts
- Grip fighting
- Weight placement

---

## Exploit

!!! info "The Finish Phase"
    **Question:** "Can I finish from here?"

    **Goal:** Deal damage or complete submission.

Exploit is the payoff — where control becomes damage or finish. This is the purpose of Access and Stabilize.

- Striking from dominant position
- Submission attempts
- Ground and pound
- TKO accumulation

**Games focused on Exploit:**
- Sustained Offense
- Wall Grinding
- Ground Finish

**Key Skills:**
- Recognizing finishing opportunities
- Committing to finish
- Maintaining position while attacking
- Chaining attacks

---

## Counter

!!! info "The Defensive Phase"
    **Question:** "Can I escape or reverse?"

    **Goal:** Deny opponent's exploitation, escape, or reverse position.

Counter is the defensive response — what happens when you're on the wrong side of the exchange. Success in Counter returns you to Access (your own, or neutral).

- Defending strikes
- Escaping positions
- Reversing control
- Standing up from bottom

**Games focused on Counter:**
- Close-Range Defense
- Wall Escape
- Ground Escape
- Leg Reclaim
- All defensive games

**Key Skills:**
- Survival techniques
- Recognizing escape windows
- Defensive submissions
- Technical stand-up

## State Transitions

The states flow into each other:

### Offensive Flow
```
Access → Stabilize → Exploit → (Finish or lose position) → Access
```

### Defensive Flow
```
Counter → (Escape) → Access (your turn) or Counter (still defending)
```

### Position Loss
```
Exploit → (Opponent escapes) → Access (chase) or Counter (they reversed)
```

## Application to Games

Every game in the system can be mapped to decision states:

| Environment | Access | Stabilize | Exploit | Counter |
|-------------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Striking** | Touch Game, Winning Circle | Sustained Offense | KO/TKO | Close-Range Defense |
| **Wrestling** | Boundary Trigger, Takedowns | Wall Control | Ground transitions | Takedown Defense |
| **Wall** | Pressure to Wall | Wall Control | Wall Grinding | Wall Escape |
| **Ground** | Ground Access | Ground Control | Ground Finish | Ground Escape, Leg Reclaim |

---

## Training Implications

### 1. Know Your State
At any moment, you should know which state you're in. This determines your immediate priority.

### 2. Don't Skip States
Trying to Exploit without Stabilizing leads to scrambles. Stabilize before you attack.

### 3. Transitions Are Vulnerable
Moving between states creates openings. Both for you and your opponent.

### 4. Counter Resets the Game
Successful Counter returns the fight to neutral or gives you Access. It's not just survival — it's opportunity.

## Summary

The four decision states provide a universal framework:

1. **Access** — Get there
2. **Stabilize** — Hold it
3. **Exploit** — Finish it
4. **Counter** — Escape it

Every technique, position, and game fits somewhere in this cycle. Understanding where you are determines what you should do next.

!!! abstract "System Integration"
    Decision States appear throughout the game system. When a game description mentions "Access phase" or "Counter state," it's referring to this framework. Understanding the states helps you see how individual games fit into the larger combat picture.
