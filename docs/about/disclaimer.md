## Coach Supervision Required

!!! warning "Critical Safety Notice"
    **All gameplay in this system should be conducted under the supervision of a qualified coach or experienced practitioner.**

The games in this system involve physical contact, striking, grappling, and submissions. These activities carry inherent risk of injury. Proper supervision is essential for:

- Ensuring appropriate intensity levels
- Monitoring safety during play
- Providing technical guidance
- Intervening when necessary
- Adapting games to participant skill levels

---

## What Constitutes a "Qualified Coach"?

This system does not certify coaches or define qualification standards. The determination of whether someone is qualified to supervise training is:

- **Subjective** — Based on the judgment of participants
- **Contextual** — Depends on the specific activities being conducted
- **The participant's responsibility** — You choose who you trust to guide your training

Consider these factors when evaluating a coach:

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Experience** | How long have they trained? Competed? Coached? |
| **Knowledge** | Do they understand the techniques and safety considerations? |
| **Track Record** | What is their history with student safety and development? |
| **Communication** | Can they explain concepts clearly and adapt to different learners? |
| **Environment** | Is the training space safe and appropriately equipped? |

!!! info "Your Responsibility"
    If you choose to learn from someone, you are accepting responsibility for that choice. This system provides the games — it does not evaluate or endorse any particular coach or gym.
