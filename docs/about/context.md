# Project Context & Goals

This document explains the **intent, philosophy, and structural goals** of the Ecological MMA Games System.

---

## What We Are Building

We are building a **constraints-led, ecological training framework for MMA**.

The output is:

- A structured **knowledge base** written in Markdown
- Rendered as a navigable documentation site
- Organized to scale into a **sellable product or curriculum**

!!! note "Key Distinction"
    The system is **game-based**, not technique-based. We are not cataloging moves. We are organizing **repeating MMA problems** and the environments that shape them.

## Core Training Philosophy

### 1. MMA is a Decision System

MMA interactions repeat predictable **decision patterns**:

- Accessing an opponent
- Stabilizing position
- Exploiting with strikes or submissions
- Countering escapes or reversals

The system is designed around these **decision states**, not named techniques.

### 2. The Environment Does the Teaching

We use **Representative Design**:

- Behavior should emerge from constraints
- Athletes learn by solving problems, not following instructions
- The coach designs the environment, not the solution

Games are constructed so correct behavior is **rewarded naturally**.

### 3. Control Precedes Damage

Across all environments:

- **Control comes before striking**
- **Stability comes before exploitation**

Strikes are allowed in most games, but they are informational and carry positional trade-offs.

### 4. Every Offense Needs a Defense

The system is built symmetrically:

- If we teach pinning, we teach escaping
- If we teach takedowns, we teach scrambles
- No domination layer exists without resistance

## Design Rules

### Games vs Levels

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Game** | A distinct learning problem with stable environment, clear goal, defined invariants, and clear win conditions |
| **Level** | A progression inside the same game with stricter success criteria |

**Rule of thumb:**

- If the environment or dominant constraint changes → **New game**
- If difficulty or completion increases → **New level**

See: [Levels vs Games](levels-vs-games.md)

## End State Vision

The long-term goal is:

- [x] Comprehensive ecological MMA curriculum
- [x] Navigable via visual map
- [x] Usable by coaches as reference and planning tool
- [ ] Extensible into a commercial product

---

## System Evolution Philosophy

This framework is intentionally **non-dogmatic**.

If new information, competitive insight, or safety considerations arise:

- Concepts may be refined
- Definitions may be updated
- Games may be reorganized

The only requirements are:

- Ecological validity
- Internal consistency
- Safety
- Clarity of learning objectives

    This context document reflects the current best understanding of the system's intent. It may be revised as the framework evolves.
