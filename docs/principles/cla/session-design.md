## The GROW Model (Adapted for CLA)

| Component | Question | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **G - Goal** | What is the intention for this session? | Establish primary focus |
| **R - Reality** | Where is the athlete now? | Assess current skill level |
| **O - Options** | What activities will bridge the gap? | Select practice environments |
| **W - Way Forward** | How will you implement? | Plan delivery and preparation |

---

## GROW: Detailed Framework

### G - GOAL

**Questions:**

1. What is the goal/intention for this session?
2. How does this link to the overall goal?
3. What is the focus for learning?

**Considerations:**

- Align coach and athlete intentions
- Connect to long-term development
- Identify the "rate limiter"

---

### R - REALITY

**Questions:**

1. What is the current skill level? (Coordination or Adaptability?)
2. What affordances need to be designed-in?
3. Which? Why? When?

**Assessment:**

- Use observation, video analysis, performance data
- Consider physical, technical, tactical, psychological factors
- Identify specific needs for this session

---

### O - OPTIONS

**Questions:**

1. What practice activities will bridge the gap?
2. Which practice environment will you use?
3. What constraints will you use and how will you manipulate them?
4. How will you measure performance?

**Success Criteria Framework:**

We will know we have been successful if...

- We **SEE**... (observable behaviors)
- The **DATA SHOWS**... (measurable outcomes)
- The **COACH SAYS**... (qualitative assessment)
- The **PERFORMER FEELS**... (subjective experience)

---

### W - WAY FORWARD

**Questions:**

1. How will you prepare the practice environment?
2. How will you prepare the performers for the session?
3. Is there anything else needed to be ready?

**Preparation:**

- Physical setup (equipment, space, constraints)
- Mental preparation (framing, expectations, instructions)
- Cultural environment (values, beliefs, climate)

## Session Flow Pattern

**Recommended Structure:**

1. **Start in GREEN ZONE** - Build confidence, assess baseline
2. **Move to AMBER ZONE** - Challenge, promote adaptation
3. **Return to GREEN ZONE** - Consolidate, end successfully

```
GREEN → AMBER → GREEN
(Confidence) → (Challenge) → (Consolidation)
```

**Why This Pattern:**

- Athletes arrive in varied states; green zone calibrates and builds confidence
- Amber zone provides the productive instability needed for learning
- Returning to green zone allows consolidation and ends session positively

## Scaling Difficulty

### The Two Dials

**1. Representativeness Dial (RLD)**

```
[1]----[2]----[3]----[4]----[5]----[6]----[7]----[8]----[9]----[10]
 ↑                                                               ↑
Low RLD                                                      High RLD
(Modified, simplified)                                (Full competition)
```

**2. Variability Dial**

```
[GREEN ZONE]----------[AMBER ZONE]----------[RED ZONE]
      ↑                    ↑                     ↑
Stable/Predictable    Productive          Too much chaos
                     Instability
```

**Use Together:** High RLD + Amber Zone = maximum learning transfer. Low RLD + Green Zone = safe exploration for beginners.

## Constraint Manipulation During Sessions

### When to Tighten Constraints

- Athletes are lost or frustrated (too much chaos)
- Need to channel exploration in specific direction
- Building confidence after failure
- Introducing new concept

### When to Loosen Constraints

- Athletes are succeeding too easily
- Patterns are becoming rigid
- Need to test adaptability
- Building toward competition demands

### Adjustment Signals

| Signal | Meaning | Adjust To |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| High success, low effort | Too easy | Increase challenge (loosen/add constraints) |
| Frustration, repeated failure | Too hard | Decrease challenge (tighten/remove constraints) |
| Trying new solutions | Productive instability | Maintain current level |
| Rigid, repetitive patterns | System capture | Increase variability |

## Integration with Training Periodization

| Phase | RLD Level | Variability | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Off-Season** | Lower | Higher | Exploration, new skills |
| **Pre-Camp** | Moderate | Moderate | Building specific patterns |
| **Fight Camp** | Higher | Lower | Refining for specific opponent |
| **Fight Week** | Highest | Lowest | Execution, confidence |
