## About This Knowledge Base

This is the theoretical foundation for our ecological MMA training system. Every game, every constraint, every design decision traces back to the principles documented here.

**How to use this reference:**

- **New to CLA?** Start with [Theory](theory.md) then [Key Concepts](key-concepts.md)
- **Designing a session?** See [Environment Design](environment-design.md) and [Session Design](session-design.md)
- **Building MMA games?** Reference [MMA Applications](mma-applications.md)
- **Coaching?** Check [Implementation](implementation.md) and [Pitfalls](pitfalls.md)
- **Quick lookup?** Use the [Glossary](glossary.md) or [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md)

## Core Framework Overview

### What is the Constraints-Led Approach?

The Constraints-Led Approach (CLA) is a coaching methodology predicated on **Ecological Dynamics Theory** that views:

- Athletes and teams as **complex adaptive systems**
- Skill as **successful adaptation to the environment** (not acquisition of fixed techniques)
- Learning as emerging from the **interaction of constraints** (not instruction-following)
- The coach as an **environment architect/learning designer** (not a technique prescriber)

### Key Relationship Hierarchy

CONSTRAINTS-LED APPROACH (Methodology)
```

### Fundamental Premise

> "The individual–environment relationship is the appropriate scale of analysis for understanding human behavior."

**For MMA:** The fighter-environment relationship (including opponent, cage/ring, rules, surface) is the fundamental unit—not the fighter in isolation.

## The Four Environment Design Principles

These principles operationalize CLA into actionable coaching methodology:

| # | Principle | Core Question |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Session Intention** | What is the overriding goal that guides all decisions? |
| 2 | **Constrain to Afford** | What constraints will invite the behaviors we want? |
| 3 | **Representative Learning Design** | Does practice look AND feel like competition? |
| 4 | **Repetition Without Repetition** | Are we repeating problem-solving, not movements? |

See [Environment Design](environment-design.md) for full details.

## How CLA Informs Our Game Design

Every game in this system embodies CLA principles:

| CLA Principle | How It Appears in Games |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Constraints shape behavior | Rules create the learning environment |
| Affordances invite action | Scoring systems reward target behaviors |
| Self-organization | Athletes discover solutions, not prescribed techniques |
| Representative design | Games include opponent, pressure, context |
| Perception-action coupling | Reading and reacting stay connected |
| Variability | Multiple levels, opponent types, conditions |
