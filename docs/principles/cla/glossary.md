## A

**Action Fidelity**
: The degree to which movement solutions developed in practice will be effective in the performance environment.

**Adaptation**
: The process by which behavior becomes better suited to a specific environment.

**Affective Learning Design (ALD)**
: Practice design that represents the emotional demands of competition, ensuring practice not only looks like but feels like the real thing.

**Affordance**
: An opportunity for action that the environment offers relative to an individual's capabilities. Affordances are relational (between person and environment), action-relevant, and can be perceived directly.

**Affordance Landscape**
: The range of opportunities for action available in a practice or performance environment, ranging from narrow (few options) to rich (many options).

**Attunement**
: The process of becoming increasingly sensitive to relevant information in the environment.

---

## C

**Calibration**
: Adjusting the relationship between perceived information and action execution to achieve desired outcomes.

**Co-Adaptation**
: The continuous mutual adjustment between interacting individuals, such as attacker and defender in combat sports.

**Complex Adaptive System**
: A system composed of many interacting components that can adapt and self-organize. Athletes and teams are viewed as complex adaptive systems in CLA.

**Constraints**
: Information sources that shape the emergence of behavior; boundaries that guide organization. Constraints are not negative limitations but neutral features that reduce possible configurations to functional ones.

**Constraints-Led Approach (CLA)**
: A coaching methodology based on manipulating task, individual, and environmental constraints to guide skill development through self-organization rather than prescription.

**Coordinative Structure**
: See Synergy.

---

## D

**Degeneracy**
: The ability of structurally different elements to achieve the same functional outcome. In MMA, having multiple techniques that can accomplish the same goal (e.g., various ways to achieve a takedown).

**Degrees of Freedom**
: The independent components (muscles, joints, limb segments) that must be organized for coordinated action. The "degrees of freedom problem" refers to the challenge of organizing these many components.

**Dexterity**
: The ability to find motor solutions that are correct, quick, rational, and resourceful. Reflects the ability to solve novel movement problems in the moment.

**Dyadic System**
: A two-person interaction unit (e.g., attacker-defender pair) that forms the basic unit of analysis in combat sports.

---

## E

**Ecological Dynamics**
: The theoretical framework integrating ecological psychology, dynamical systems theory, and complexity science that underlies CLA.

**Effectivity**
: An individual's capability to act on environmental affordances. The complement to affordance (environment offers, individual can use).

**Emergence**
: Novel behaviors arising from the interaction of system components, not prescribed or pre-planned. In CLA, technique emerges from constraints rather than being taught directly.

**Environment Design Principles (EDP)**
: Framework of four principles for CLA session design: Session Intention, Constrain to Afford, Representative Learning Design, and Repetition Without Repetition.

**Environmental Constraints**
: Global features external to the task that shape behavior, including physical conditions (temperature, surface), social factors (culture, crowd), and historical factors (traditions, rule evolution).

---

## F

**Fixed Principles**
: Signature positions or anchors that functional movements tend to pass through, representing stable states in coordination.

**Form of Life**
: The behaviors, skills, attitudes, and practices that shape culture in a society, organization, or training environment.

**Freezing Degrees of Freedom**
: A strategy in early learning where the performer locks out movement options to reduce complexity, resulting in stiff or rigid movement patterns.

---

## G

**Green Zone**
: A variability zone representing optimal challenge where success likelihood is high, exploration is promoted, and adaptability can develop without overwhelming the learner.

**GROW Model**
: Goal-Reality-Options-Way Forward planning framework adapted for CLA session design.

---

## I

**Individual Constraints**
: Personal characteristics unique to each performer that shape behavior, including physical (height, weight), psychological (motivation, confidence), experiential (skill level, history), and biological (fatigue, injury) factors. Also called Organismic Constraints.

**Individual-Environment Mutuality**
: The inseparable relationship between performer and performance context. The fundamental premise of ecological dynamics.

**Instability**
: Temporary perturbation of existing patterns, often necessary for reorganization and learning. Distinguished from stability (consistent patterns) and chaos (excessive disruption).

**Intention**
: A goal-directed cognitive state that shapes perception-action coupling. Session intention is the overriding goal that guides constraint manipulation.

**Intrinsic Dynamics**
: Existing coordination tendencies an individual brings to a learning situation, which interact with task demands to produce behavior.

---

## K

**Knowledge ABOUT**
: Declarative, verbalizable understanding of the environment, gained through instruction, video, and discussion.

**Knowledge OF**
: Procedural, action-supporting understanding developed only through direct experience in the environment. Cannot be taught verbally.

---

## N

**Nonlinear Pedagogy**
: The pedagogical framework derived from ecological dynamics that serves as the bridge between theory and CLA methodology.

**Nonlinearity**
: Disproportionate relationship between inputs and outputs; small changes can have large effects, and large changes can have small effects. Learning is nonlinear.

---

## O

**Optimal Grip**
: Having functional control over the field of affordances in a given context. The hallmark of skilled performance.

**Organismic Constraints**
: See Individual Constraints.

**Over-Constraining**
: Manipulating constraints to force rather than invite behavior, removing decision-making and exploration.

---

## P

**Perception-Action Coupling**
: The tight integration of information pickup and movement execution. Information regulates action; action guides further information pickup. A continuous loop, not sequential processes.

---

## R

**Rate Limiter**
: A constraint that currently limits the emergence of higher-level performance. Identifying the rate limiter helps target training.

**Red Zone**
: A variability zone representing excessive chaos where variability is unmanageable, overwhelm occurs, and learning is disrupted.

**Repetition Without Repetition**
: Bernstein's principle that practice should repeat the process of problem-solving rather than identical movements. Variation in execution while repeating the goal.

**Representative Learning Design (RLD)**
: Practice design that samples critical informational features of the performance environment, ensuring what athletes see, hear, and feel in practice is similar to competition.

---

## S

**Self-Organization**
: Spontaneous emergence of coordinated patterns without external micromanagement. Behavior organizes itself under constraints rather than being prescribed.

**Session Intention**
: The overriding goal that guides constraint manipulation in a training session. One of the four EDP principles.

**Shared Affordances**
: Opportunities for action that exist between multiple individuals, as in partner or team training.

**Skill**
: In ecological dynamics, the ability to successfully adapt to a performance environment. Defined as relationship between performer and environment, not as internal acquisition.

**Soft Assembly**
: The temporary, context-dependent formation of coordinative structures. Synergies are soft assembled (not hardwired) and can rapidly form and dissolve.

**Synergy**
: A temporarily assembled grouping of body segments, muscles, and joints that function as a single unit to achieve a task goal. Also called Coordinative Structure.

---

## T

**Task Constraints**
: Features specific to the activity being performed that shape behavior, including goals, rules, equipment, spatial boundaries, and time limits.

**Task Decomposition**
: Breaking a task into isolated parts for separate practice. Problematic in CLA because it separates perception from action.

**Task Simplification**
: Scaling difficulty while keeping the task whole. Preferred over decomposition because it maintains perception-action coupling.

**Transfer**
: The application of learning from one context (training) to another (competition). The ultimate measure of training effectiveness.

---

## V

**Variability**
: Differences in movement patterns or practice conditions. In CLA, variability is deliberately designed into practice to build adaptability.

**Variability Zones**
: Categories (Green/Amber/Red) describing the challenge level of practice environments, from stable and predictable to chaotic and overwhelming.

---

## Amber Zone

A variability zone representing productive instability at the "edge of chaos" where new solutions must be searched for, reorganization is promoted, and optimal learning occurs.
