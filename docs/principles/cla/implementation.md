## The Coach as Environment Architect

**Role Shift:**

| Traditional Coach | CLA Coach |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Technique prescriber | Environment designer |
| Tells athletes what to do | Creates conditions for emergence |
| Corrects movements | Manipulates constraints |
| Source of solutions | Facilitator of discovery |

---

## Five Key Questions for Constraint Manipulation

| Question | Guides |
|----------|--------|
| **WHAT** constraints to manipulate? | Selection from Task, Individual, Environment categories |
| **HOW** to manipulate them? | Amount of change, direction |
| **WHEN** to apply/remove them? | Timing within and between sessions |
| **WHY** use this constraint? | Connection to session intention |
| **WHOM** is this appropriate for? | Individual differences |

---

## Instruction Guidelines

### Use Verbal Instructions To:

- Direct attention to affordances (not prescribe actions)
- Frame intentions and goals
- Provide knowledge ABOUT (to complement knowledge OF)
- Guide exploration (not replace it)

### Avoid Using Instructions To:

- Prescribe exact movements
- Remove decision-making
- Direct internal focus of attention
- Replace experiential learning

---

## External vs. Internal Focus

| External Focus (Preferred) | Internal Focus (Problematic) |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Effect on environment | Body part movement |
| Target/outcome | Muscle activation |
| Opponent/partner | Joint angles |
| Equipment contact | Limb positions |

**Example:**

- Internal (avoid): "Rotate your hip when you punch"
- External (use): "Drive through the target with your fist"

**Why:** External focus promotes automatic, fluid movement. Internal focus disrupts natural coordination.

---

## Attention Directing Cues

### Good Cues (External, Outcome-Focused)

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Target-focused** | "Hit the chin", "Control the wrist" |
| **Effect-focused** | "Make them feel your weight", "Move them" |
| **Distance-focused** | "Close the space", "Create distance" |
| **Outcome-focused** | "Score the takedown", "Land clean" |

### Poor Cues (Internal, Mechanical)

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Body part** | "Rotate your hips", "Turn your shoulder" |
| **Muscle** | "Squeeze your glutes", "Engage your core" |
| **Joint** | "Bend your elbow to 90 degrees" |
| **Position** | "Keep your hands at chin level" |

---

## Feedback Guidelines

### Types of Feedback

| Feedback Type | When to Use | How to Deliver |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Knowledge of Results (KR)** | After attempts | Outcome information ("That landed", "You escaped") |
| **Knowledge of Performance (KP)** | After attempts | Process information ("You read the level change early") |
| **Concurrent** | During performance | Real-time cues ("Now!", "There!") |
| **Questions** | After exploration | Promote reflection ("What did you notice?") |

---

### Feedback Frequency

| Athlete Level | Feedback Frequency | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Beginner** | More frequent | Need guidance, can't self-assess well |
| **Intermediate** | Moderate | Building self-assessment capability |
| **Advanced** | Less frequent | Can self-assess, too much feedback disrupts |

**Key Principle:** Reduce feedback over time to develop self-regulation.

---

### Questioning Approach

**Instead of telling, ask:**

- "What did you notice about their weight distribution?"
- "What options did you see there?"
- "What would happen if you...?"
- "What made that one work?"

**Benefits:**

- Develops athlete's perception
- Builds self-assessment capability
- Promotes ownership of solutions
- Creates knowledge OF through reflection

---

## Assessment & Evaluation

### What to Measure

| Dimension | Metrics | Methods |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Outcome** | Success rate, win/loss | Competition results, drill completion |
| **Process** | Movement quality, decisions | Video analysis, observation |
| **Adaptation** | Response to variability | Novel situation testing |
| **Transfer** | Competition performance | Match analysis vs. training performance |

---

### Observation Framework

**What to watch for:**

1. **Search behaviors** - Is the athlete exploring options?
2. **Solution variety** - Are multiple techniques emerging?
3. **Reading ability** - Is the athlete perceiving affordances?
4. **Response timing** - Are reactions becoming more coupled?
5. **Stability under pressure** - Do skills hold when challenged?

---

### Transfer Assessment

**Key Question:** Does training performance transfer to competition?

**Assessment Approach:**

1. Compare training behaviors to competition behaviors
2. Assess decision-making quality under pressure
3. Evaluate adaptability to novel situations
4. Track competition outcomes over time

**Warning Signs (Low Transfer):**

- Skills appear in training but not competition
- Athlete reverts to old patterns under pressure
- Decision-making degrades in live settings
- Techniques work only against familiar partners

---

## Managing the Learning Environment

### Creating Psychological Safety

**Environment must allow:**

- Failure without judgment
- Exploration without ridicule
- Questions without shame
- Mistakes as information, not character flaws

**Coach behaviors:**

- Celebrate exploration, not just success
- Frame failures as data
- Model curiosity about problems
- Avoid punitive responses to errors

---

### Managing Frustration

**Productive frustration:**

- Signals the AMBER zone
- Precedes breakthrough
- Should be supported, not eliminated

**Unproductive frustration:**

- Signals the RED zone
- Leads to shutdown or regression
- Requires constraint adjustment

**Coach response:**

- Recognize the difference
- Tighten constraints if in RED zone
- Encourage persistence if in AMBER zone
- Verbally acknowledge the challenge

---

### Individualization

**Know each athlete's:**

- Current learning stage (coordination vs. adaptability)
- Individual constraints (physical, psychological)
- Optimal challenge level
- Response to feedback styles
- Historical background

**Adjust accordingly:**

- Constraint selection
- Variability amount
- Feedback frequency and type
- Session intensity
