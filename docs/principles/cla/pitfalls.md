## Pitfall 1: Over-Constraining

### Problem

Forcing behavior rather than inviting it.

### Signs

- Athletes have no decisions to make
- Only one "correct" solution exists
- Creativity is stifled
- Training feels like following orders

### Example

**Over-constrained:** "When I throw, you must parry with your lead hand, then throw a jab-cross."

**Why it fails:** Removes all decision-making. Athlete learns to follow instructions, not read situations.

### Solution

Design constraints that channel exploration while allowing choice.

**Better:** "Defend my attack, then counter. Points for clean counters." The athlete chooses the defense and counter based on what they perceive.

---

## Pitfall 2: Under-Constraining

### Problem

Environment is too vague, lacks direction.

### Signs

- Athletes don't know what to focus on
- Randomness without purpose
- No learning direction
- Sessions feel aimless

### Example

**Under-constrained:** "Just spar and work on stuff."

**Why it fails:** No session intention. Athletes default to comfortable patterns. No targeted development.

### Solution

Establish clear session intentions, design specific affordances.

**Better:** "Spar with a focus on creating angles after your opponent attacks. Points for landing while off the center line."

---

## Pitfall 3: Low Representative Design

### Problem

Practice doesn't transfer to competition.

### Signs

- Techniques work in training, fail in fights
- Athletes can't read opponents
- Decision-making is poor under pressure
- Performance in drills doesn't match performance in sparring

### Example

**Low RLD:** Practicing takedown defense against a partner who shoots on command without setups.

**Why it fails:** No reading required—the defender knows when the attack is coming. In competition, the defender must read the level change.

### Solution

Include relevant information sources, maintain perception-action coupling.

**Better:** Attacker can shoot anytime within a round. May or may not shoot. Defender must read and react.

---

## Pitfall 4: "Game is the Teacher" Misinterpretation

### Problem

Coach becomes too passive, lacks direction.

### Signs

- Vague practice without purpose
- No targeted development
- Athletes underchallenged or overwhelmed
- Coach stands back and watches without adjusting

### Example

"The game teaches, so I just let them play."

**Why it fails:** The game only teaches if it's well-designed. Without constraint manipulation, athletes may just repeat existing patterns.

### Solution

Coach is an active environment architect, not passive observer.

**The coach's job:**

- Design the game with clear intention
- Observe athlete responses
- Adjust constraints based on what emerges
- Create progressions that challenge and develop

---

## Pitfall 5: Ignoring Individual Differences

### Problem

One-size-fits-all approach.

### Signs

- Same drills for all athletes
- Frustration from mismatched challenge
- Some athletes progress, others stagnate
- No consideration of physical/psychological differences

### Example

Running all athletes through identical sessions regardless of their size, background, or skill level.

**Why it fails:** A 5'5" wrestler and a 6'2" kickboxer have different individual constraints. The same game will invite different affordances for each.

### Solution

Know each athlete's history, current level, and needs. Adjust constraints individually.

**Considerations:**

- Physical attributes (reach, weight, mobility)
- Technical background (grappling vs. striking base)
- Psychological profile (aggressive vs. reactive)
- Current learning stage (coordination vs. adaptability)

---

## Pitfall 6: Eliminating All Instruction

### Problem

Misunderstanding that CLA means no verbal guidance.

### Signs

- Athletes have no context
- Wasted time discovering basics
- Principles of play unknown
- Athletes frustrated by lack of direction

### Example

Refusing to explain anything because "discovery learning means they figure it out themselves."

**Why it fails:** CLA doesn't mean no instruction. It means instruction supports exploration rather than replacing it.

### Solution

Use instructions to direct attention and frame intentions, not prescribe actions.

**Good instruction in CLA:**

- "Notice when their weight shifts forward—that's your cue"
- "The goal is to create space; how you do it is up to you"
- "Pay attention to the pressure through their grips"

**Not good instruction:**

- "When they do X, you must do Y"
- "Your elbow needs to be at this angle"
- "Execute the technique exactly like this"

---

## Pitfall 7: Abandoning Structure

### Problem

Believing CLA means chaotic, unplanned sessions.

### Signs

- No session intention
- Random constraint manipulation
- No progression or connection between sessions
- Athletes unsure what they're supposed to be learning

### Example

"CLA is all about emergence, so I don't plan sessions—I just see what happens."

**Why it fails:** Emergence happens within constraints. Without thoughtful constraint design, nothing meaningful emerges.

### Solution

Use systematic framework (GROW, EDP) while remaining adaptive.

**CLA sessions are:**

- Planned (clear intention, designed constraints)
- Structured (progression through zones)
- Adaptive (adjustments based on what emerges)
- Connected (build on previous sessions)

---

## Pitfall 8: Misunderstanding Variability

### Problem

Adding randomness without purpose.

### Signs

- Constant change with no rationale
- Athletes never develop stability
- Sessions feel chaotic
- No skill consolidation

### Example

Changing the drill every 2 minutes "for variability."

**Why it fails:** Variability serves adaptability, but athletes also need time to explore and stabilize solutions.

### Solution

Match variability to learning stage and session intention.

| Stage | Variability Approach |
|-------|---------------------|
| Coordination | Lower variability, allow exploration of solutions |
| Adaptability | Higher variability, stress-test solutions |

**Remember:** The goal is "repetition without repetition"—repeating the problem-solving process, not identical movements. This still requires time with each problem.

---

## Pitfall 9: Confusing Simplification with Decomposition

### Problem

Breaking tasks apart instead of scaling them.

### Signs

- Isolated technical drilling
- Skills practiced without context
- Perception separated from action
- "Parts" of techniques practiced independently

### Example

**Decomposition:** Practicing the "hand movement" of a jab without footwork, then practicing footwork without hands, then "putting it together."

**Why it fails:** The jab is a whole-body action where all parts inform each other. Separating them breaks the synergy.

### Solution

Simplify by scaling the whole task, not by decomposing it.

**Simplification examples:**

- Slower tempo (but whole technique)
- Reduced threat (lighter contact, but whole exchange)
- Smaller space (but whole movement)
- Limited options (but whole decision process)

---

## Pitfall 10: Neglecting Affective Design

### Problem

Practice looks like competition but doesn't feel like it.

### Signs

- Athletes perform well in training, freeze in competition
- Emotional regulation skills don't transfer
- Pressure situations cause breakdown
- "It's different when it counts"

### Example

Sparring that's technically similar to fighting but has no consequences, pressure, or emotional intensity.

**Why it fails:** Competition includes emotional demands. If training doesn't represent these, athletes aren't prepared for them.

### Solution

Include emotional representativeness (Affective Learning Design).

**Methods:**

- Scoring with visible results
- Consequences for outcomes
- Time pressure
- Competition simulation
- Audience/observation
- Stakes (winner doesn't clean mats, etc.)

## Quick Diagnostic

| Problem | Likely Pitfall | Solution Direction |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Athletes don't explore | Over-constraining | Loosen constraints, allow more choice |
| Training is aimless | Under-constraining | Add clear intention and constraints |
| Skills don't transfer | Low RLD | Increase representativeness |
| Coach feels useless | "Game teaches" misunderstanding | Be active architect, not passive |
| Some athletes stagnate | Ignoring individual differences | Individualize constraints |
| Athletes are lost | Eliminating instruction | Add attention-directing cues |
| Sessions feel random | Abandoning structure | Use GROW/EDP frameworks |
| No skill stability | Misunderstanding variability | Allow consolidation time |
| Parts don't integrate | Decomposition | Use simplification instead |
| Freeze under pressure | Neglecting affect | Add emotional demands |
