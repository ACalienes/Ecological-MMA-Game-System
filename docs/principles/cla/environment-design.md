!!! abstract "Sources"
    The four Environment Design Principles are the core methodology from Renshaw et al. (2019).
    Representative Learning Design draws on Pinder et al. (2011). Repetition Without Repetition originates with Bernstein (1967).

## Overview

The EDP framework operationalizes CLA into four actionable principles:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           ENVIRONMENT DESIGN PRINCIPLES             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Session Intention                               │
│  2. Constrain to Afford                             │
│  3. Representative Learning Design                  │
│  4. Repetition Without Repetition                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

These four principles guide every coaching decision in the ecological approach.

## PRINCIPLE 1: Session Intention

**Guiding Statement:** *"The intentions of the session act as an overriding and organizational constraint."*
— Renshaw et al., 2019

### Key Points

- Intentions shape cognitions, perceptions, and actions
- Coach and athlete intentions must be **aligned**
- Intentions determine constraint manipulation decisions
- Intentions vary with training phase (pre-season vs. competition week)

---

### Session Intention Categories

| Category | Goal | Approach |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Learning** | Develop new skills/patterns | Higher challenge, acceptance of failure |
| **Adapting** | Refine existing patterns | Varied conditions, problem-solving |
| **Performing** | Execute under pressure | Representative conditions, intensity |
| **Attuning** | Calibrate to environment | Familiarization, preparation |

---

### Matching Intentions to Learning Stage

| Athlete Level | Session Focus |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Coordination Stage** | Exploring, searching for solutions |
| **Adaptability Stage** | Exploiting, refining, optimizing |

**For MMA:** A fighter learning takedown defense (coordination stage) needs sessions focused on exploring defensive options. A fighter refining their takedown defense (adaptability stage) needs varied attackers and conditions to stress-test their solutions.

---

## PRINCIPLE 2: Constrain to Afford

**Guiding Statement:** *"Design-in constraints to offer/invite/encourage learners to explore opportunities for action related to the session intention."*
— Renshaw et al., 2019

### The Three-Step Process

1. **OFFER** key affordances related to session intention
2. **INVITE** engagement through exaggeration/emphasis
3. **AVOID** over-constraining (forcing vs. inviting)

---

### Constraining Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Exaggeration** | Amplify affordances to make them obvious | Larger targets, slower speeds |
| **Emphasis** | Draw attention to specific affordances | Reward systems, verbal cues |
| **Restriction** | Limit options to channel exploration | Reduce techniques available |
| **Addition** | Add elements to create affordances | Include opponents, obstacles |

---

### Over-Constraining vs. Effective Constraining

| Over-Constraining (Avoid) | Effective Constraining (Use) |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| "Two-touch only" rules | Reward systems for quick passing |
| Forced technique prescription | Environmental setup that invites technique |
| Removing all decision-making | Channeling decisions within options |
| Static, unopposed drilling | Dynamic, contextual practice |

---

### Co-Adaptation Principle

**Key Insight:** Constrain the opposition to facilitate behavior change in your athletes.

**Application:**

- Apply task constraints to defenders → attackers adapt
- Apply task constraints to attackers → defenders adapt
- Creates representative, functional learning

**MMA Example:** To develop counter-striking, constrain the attacker to initiate first. The defender (primary learner) must then read and respond—the constraint on the attacker creates the learning opportunity for the defender.

---

## PRINCIPLE 3: Representative Learning Design (RLD)

**Guiding Statement:** *"Ensure that what learners are seeing, hearing, and feeling in the practice environment is similar to the performance environment."*
— Renshaw et al., 2019

*RLD framework developed by Pinder, Davids, Renshaw, & Araújo (2011)*

### Core Concept: Action Fidelity

> **"The movement solutions performers develop in practice must be effective when transferred to the performance environment."**

### Core Question

> **"Does the practice environment sample the critical informational constraints present in the performance environment?"**

---

### RLD Assessment Questions

1. Does practice contain relevant **informational constraints** from performance?
2. Is **perception-action coupling** maintained (not decomposed)?
3. Are the **emotional demands** represented (Affective Learning Design)?
4. Will learned behaviors **transfer** to competition?

---

### RLD Continuum

```
LOW REPRESENTATIVENESS ←───────────────────→ HIGH REPRESENTATIVENESS
   (Modified conditions,                        (Full competition
    simplified context)                          simulation)
```

**Neither extreme is always appropriate—match RLD to athlete needs.**

---

### RLD Assessment Checklist

| Element | Question | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Information Sources** | Are relevant visual, haptic, acoustic cues present? | ☐ |
| **Perception-Action Coupling** | Is perceiving and acting integrated (not separated)? | ☐ |
| **Decision-Making** | Are decisions required similar to competition? | ☐ |
| **Opponents/Partners** | Are human interactions included (not static objects)? | ☐ |
| **Emotional Intensity** | Is appropriate pressure/consequence present? | ☐ |
| **Time Constraints** | Is temporal pressure representative? | ☐ |
| **Space Constraints** | Is spatial setup representative? | ☐ |

---

### Task Simplification vs. Task Decomposition

| Task Simplification (Preferred) | Task Decomposition (Problematic) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Scale difficulty while keeping task whole | Break task into isolated parts |
| Maintain perception-action coupling | Decouple perception from action |
| Preserve essential information flows | Remove context and information |
| Example: Smaller cage, slower pace | Example: Shadow boxing without target |

**Key Distinction:** Simplification keeps the task intact but adjusts difficulty. Decomposition breaks the task apart, destroying the perception-action relationship.

---

### What Reduces RLD (Avoid These)

| Practice Design Flaw | Problem Created |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Dribbling around cones | No adaptive opponent information |
| Hitting pads without partner reaction | Decoupled perception-action |
| Unopposed drilling | No defensive information to read |
| Ball machines/predictable feeds | Missing anticipatory cues |
| Static positional work | No dynamic decision-making |

---

### What Enhances RLD (Implement These)

| Practice Design Enhancement | Benefit |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Live training partners | Real affordances, adaptation |
| Varied opposition styles | Multiple solutions required |
| Consequence systems | Emotional representativeness |
| Competition simulation | Full pressure experience |
| Contextual drilling | Maintains perception-action coupling |

---

### Affective Learning Design (ALD)

**Key Question:** *"Does the practice look AND feel like the real thing?"*

**Components:**

- **Purpose** - Clear, meaningful task goals
- **Consequence** - Real outcomes for success/failure
- **Emotion** - Representative intensity and pressure

**For MMA:** Sparring looks like fighting, but does it feel like it? Adding scoring, consequences, or competition formats increases affective representativeness.

---

## PRINCIPLE 4: Repetition Without Repetition

**Guiding Statement:** *"Design-in the appropriate amount of variability and (in)stability to the practice environment."*
— Renshaw et al., 2019

*Principle originates with Bernstein (1967)*

### Bernstein's Principle

> **"Practice is a particular type of repetition without repetition."**
> — Bernstein, 1967

**Meaning:** Repeat the process of solving problems, not identical movements.

---

### Types of Practice Variability

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Task Variability** | Varying the task performed | Different techniques for same goal |
| **Environmental Variability** | Varying conditions | Different opponents, surfaces |
| **Individual Variability** | Varying performer state | Fatigued, fresh, stressed |

---

### Sources of Variability

| Source | How to Implement | MMA Example |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Task Goals** | Vary objectives | Submit vs. survive vs. control |
| **Rules** | Modify regulations | No takedowns, no striking |
| **Opponents** | Different partners | Size, style, skill level |
| **Environment** | Change conditions | Cage vs. mats, fresh vs. fatigued |
| **Equipment** | Alter gear | Different glove weights |
| **Timing** | Adjust duration | Round length, rest periods |
| **Intensity** | Vary effort level | Light flow to hard sparring |

---

### Variability Zones

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GREEN ZONE: Optimal challenge                  │
│  - High success likelihood                      │
│  - Promotes exploration                         │
│  - Enhances adaptability                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  AMBER ZONE: Productive instability             │
│  - Requires search for new solutions            │
│  - Promotes reorganization                      │
│  - Edge of chaos (optimal learning)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  RED ZONE: Excessive chaos                      │
│  - Too much variability                         │
│  - Unmanageable/overwhelming                    │
│  - Information overload                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Matching Variability to Skill Level

| Skill Level | Variability Amount | Variability Type |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Coordination Stage** | Lower variability, guide toward solutions | Systematic (controlled) |
| **Adaptability Stage** | Higher variability, challenge to explore | Unsystematic (random) |

---

### Variability Implementation Guidelines

| Athlete Level | Variability Amount | Variability Type |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Beginner** | Low | Systematic (controlled) |
| **Intermediate** | Moderate | Mixed |
| **Advanced** | High | Unsystematic (random) |

---

### Systematic vs. Unsystematic Manipulation

| Approach | Method | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Systematic** | Controlled, progressive constraint changes | Targeting specific adaptations |
| **Unsystematic** | Random, varied constraint changes | Developing general adaptability |

---

### Why Variability Matters

1. **Develops dexterity** - Multiple solutions to problems
2. **Builds degeneracy** - Functional redundancy
3. **Enhances adaptability** - Coping with novel situations
4. **Prevents system capture** - Avoiding locked-in patterns

---

### Managing Instability

**Key Principle:** Deliberately move performers to less stable areas to promote reorganization.

**Instability Indicators:**

- Increased variability in performance
- Temporary performance decrement
- Search behaviors (trying new solutions)
- Frustration (productive when managed)

**Coach Response:**

- Recognize instability as necessary for learning
- Support through the transition
- Allow time for reorganization
- Celebrate exploration, not just success
