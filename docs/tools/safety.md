# Safety & Intensity Rules

!!! danger "Non-Negotiable"
    Safety principles in this system are **non-negotiable**. They cannot be overridden for competitive pressure, athlete preference, or training efficiency.

## Five Non-Negotiable Principles

### 1. No Falling Bodyweight onto Legs

Takedowns and transitions must never involve dropping bodyweight onto an opponent's legs or knees.

### 2. Control Precedes Gravity

All takedowns are created via **off-balancing**, not dumping. The opponent's base must be compromised before descent begins.

### 3. Strikes are Informational

Strikes in training games are **light and informational**. They measure distance, create reactions, and test control — not cause damage.

### 4. Submissions are Emergent

    This section contains errors and needs revision. Content below is placeholder until corrected.

Submissions (especially DNS) are **defensive tools** that emerge from constraints. No jumping guard, no sitting to finish, no hunting submissions as primary objectives.

### 5. Coach Intervention is Mandatory

The coach must stop play immediately when:

- Structure degrades into scrambling chaos
- Intensity escalates beyond appropriate levels
- Any safety violation occurs
- Learning value has disappeared

## Intensity Guidelines

| Athlete Level | Recommended Intensity | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Beginner** | 30–40% | Focus on pattern recognition |
| **Intermediate** | 40–60% | Add resistance and timing pressure |
| **Advanced** | 60–75% | Realistic problem-solving |
| **Maximum Cap** | 80% | Never exceed in training games |

!!! warning "80% Cap"
    Even advanced athletes should not exceed 80% intensity in ecological games. These are learning environments, not competition simulations.

---

## Red Flags (Stop Immediately)

| Red Flag | Indicates |
|----------|-----------|
| Brute force without technique | Constraints are mis-set |
| Memorized repetitions without adaptation | Game is too predictable |
| Ego-driven intensity escalation | Competitive mindset has taken over |
| Panic responses | Athlete is overwhelmed |
| Static grinding without progress | No learning is occurring |

When red flags appear, **stop the game** and reassess:

- Are constraints appropriate?
- Is intensity appropriate?
- Does the athlete understand the problem?

## Specific Safety Rules by Environment

### Open Space

- No chasing collisions
- No forward crashes
- Reset if exchanges become static

### Wall

!!! bug "FLAGGED FOR REVIEW"
    This section needs revision.

- No grinding into wall
- No neck cranks
- Light strikes only

### Transitions (Wall → Ground)

- **Control precedes gravity** (critical)
- No dumping bodyweight
- No slamming
- Stop if descent becomes uncontrolled

### Ground

- No falling onto legs
- DNS recognized and stopped before completion
- No sustained suffocation

## DNS in Training

Defensive Neck Submissions (guillotines, front headlocks) occur when the attacker's head drops into a vulnerable position. The defender can capitalize on this with a choke.

**DNS is not a safety concern** — it's a natural consequence of poor head position.

- If playing to submission: DNS goes to finish
- If DNS leads to ground with submission maintained: continue to finish
- Standard tap rules apply as with any submission

---

## Intervention Language

Coaches should use clear, consistent language:

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| "Reset" | Return to starting position |
| "Freeze" | Stop all movement immediately |
| "Check intensity" | Reduce effort level |
| "Time" | Round complete |
| "Out" | Exit the game (safety concern) |

---

## Athlete Responsibility

Athletes are expected to:

- Respect tap signals immediately
- Self-regulate intensity
- Report any discomfort or injury
- Prioritize partner safety over "winning"

!!! tip "Culture of Safety"
    The safest gyms are those where athletes actively protect each other, not just themselves.

!!! abstract "System Evolution Notice"
    Safety rules may be expanded as new games or contexts are added.
