# Assessment Rubrics

Criteria for evaluating athlete performance and ensuring system integrity.

---

## Offensive Rubrics

### Stabilize Before Exploit

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| ⭐ | Attempts exploitation without establishing control |
| ⭐⭐ | Establishes control but rushes to exploit |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Consistent stabilize → exploit sequence |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Dynamic stabilization with immediate exploit recognition |

### Control Before Strike

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| ⭐ | Strikes without positional advantage |
| ⭐⭐ | Establishes position, loses it when striking |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Maintains control while threatening strikes |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Oscillates fluidly between control and strike access |

### Respect Counters

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| ⭐ | Ignores DNS and escape threats |
| ⭐⭐ | Reacts to counters after they're applied |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Anticipates and prevents counters |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Uses counter-threat awareness to set up attacks |

---

## Defensive Rubrics

### Act Early

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| ⭐ | Waits until fully controlled to act |
| ⭐⭐ | Attempts escape after position consolidates |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Acts during transition / before consolidation |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Prevents control establishment entirely |

### Use Structure

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| ⭐ | Uses strength/desperation to escape |
| ⭐⭐ | Creates frames but doesn't use them effectively |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Structural escapes with proper sequencing |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Frames and structure are pre-positioned |

### Disengage with Intent

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| ⭐ | Escapes in any direction without plan |
| ⭐⭐ | Creates space but remains vulnerable |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | Turns to face before disengaging |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Disengages to advantageous position |

## System Integrity Checks

!!! danger "Red Flags"
    If you observe these patterns, the **constraints are mis-set**, not the athlete.

| Red Flag | Likely Cause |
|----------|--------------|
| Brute force domination | Skill mismatch or intensity too high |
| Memorized repetitions | Game is too predictable |
| Ego escalation | Competitive framing instead of learning |
| Confusion about goals | Win conditions unclear |
| No defensive success | Constraints favor offense too heavily |

### Diagnosis Protocol

When red flags appear:

1. **Stop the game**
2. Review constraints and invariants
3. Check intensity levels
4. Clarify win conditions
5. Adjust and restart

## Game-Specific Assessments

### Touch Game

| Criterion | What to Look For |
|-----------|------------------|
| Range honesty | Does athlete know when they're in range? |
| Composure | How do they respond after being touched? |
| Counter-touch | Can they respond immediately? |
| Initiative recovery | How quickly do they reset mentally? |

### Wall Control

| Criterion | What to Look For |
|-----------|------------------|
| Rotation denial | Can attacker prevent shoulder rotation? |
| Balance maintenance | Does attacker maintain own structure? |
| DNS respect | Does attacker protect head position? |
| Early escape | Does defender act before consolidation? |

### Transitions

| Criterion | What to Look For |
|-----------|------------------|
| Control through transition | Is connection maintained? |
| Scramble anticipation | Does attacker read defender's movement? |
| Base compromise | Is takedown created, not forced? |
| Safety compliance | Is descent controlled? |

---

## Progress Tracking

### Level Progression Criteria

| From | To | Requirement |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Level 1 | Level 2 | Consistent success at current level |
| Level 2 | Level 3 | Can handle increased resistance |
| Level 3 | Open play | Integrates skill under realistic conditions |

### Readiness Indicators

**Ready for next level:**

- [x] Consistent success (>70% of attempts)
- [x] Maintains composure under pressure
- [x] Can articulate what they're doing and why
- [x] No safety violations

**Not ready:**

- [ ] Success is inconsistent
- [ ] Relies on athleticism over technique
- [ ] Shows frustration or ego response
- [ ] Safety lapses occur
