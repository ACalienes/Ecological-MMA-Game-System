# Session Planning Guide

This guide provides considerations for coaches planning training sessions. Sessions are **game-based from start to finish** — there is no prescribed structure.

---

## Core Philosophy

!!! warning "No Universal Session Template"
    Session structure is **entirely dependent on the training goal**. What you work on depends on:

    - The specific skill or problem being addressed
    - The athletes present and their current development
    - Whether this is general training or fight-specific preparation
    - Time available and equipment constraints

    There is no "typical session" pattern to follow.

## Warm-Up Expectations

**Athletes should arrive ready to play.**

The expectation is that athletes warm up before class begins. Games start immediately — they are the training, not something that happens after warm-up.

!!! tip "Coach Awareness"
    A coach may be aware that athletes haven't warmed up and can:

    - Start the first game at lower intensity
    - Choose a less physically demanding game to begin
    - Allow athletes to ease into full engagement

    This is **situational judgment**, not a default session structure. The system doesn't prescribe "warm-up games" as a phase.

## Planning Considerations

### 1. Goal-Driven Selection

Every session should have a clear training objective:

- What problem are we solving today?
- What skill are we developing?
- What does success look like?

Select games that address that objective. Don't run games just to fill time.

### 2. Prerequisite Awareness

Before running a game, ensure athletes have experience with its prerequisites:

- Check the game's frontmatter for prerequisite concepts and games
- If athletes lack prerequisites, address those first
- Simpler games prepare athletes for complex ones

### 3. Role Balance

In asymmetric games, ensure athletes experience both sides:

- Switch roles regularly
- Track total time in each role
- Some athletes may need more time in specific roles based on their development needs

### 4. Intensity Management

Match game intensity to session goals and athlete readiness:

- **High intensity:** Shorter rounds, more rest between
- **Skill development:** Moderate intensity, focus on quality over volume
- **Technical work:** Lower intensity, more repetitions and feedback

## Common Mistakes

!!! warning "Avoid These Pitfalls"

    - **Too much variety** — Better to develop one skill deeply than touch many superficially
    - **Skipping prerequisites** — Complex games fail without foundational skills
    - **Unbalanced roles** — Athletes need time on both sides of asymmetric games
    - **Ignoring fatigue** — Quality degrades when athletes are exhausted; adjust or end the session
    - **Rigid adherence to a plan** — If something isn't working, adapt

## Adapting to Context

### General Class vs. Fight Camp

| Context | Considerations |
|---------|----------------|
| **General class** | Broader skill development, more variety across sessions |
| **Fight camp** | Focused on specific problems the athlete needs to solve |

### Athlete Level

| Level | Considerations |
|-------|----------------|
| **Beginners** | Simpler games, more instruction, build vocabulary |
| **Intermediate** | Progress through game levels, introduce combined games |
| **Advanced** | Nuanced work, game modifications, more autonomy |

### Time Available

| Time | Considerations |
|------|----------------|
| **Short session** | Focus on one game, work through levels |
| **Long session** | Can address related skills, more games in sequence |

---

## Using Game Metadata

Each game's frontmatter includes useful planning information:

- **Prerequisites** — What must athletes already know?
- **Difficulty** — Is this appropriate for the group?
- **Duration** — How long are typical rounds?
- **Equipment** — What do we need?

Use this metadata to make informed game selections.
