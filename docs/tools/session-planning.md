# Session Planning Guide

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This guide will help coaches plan effective training sessions using the games in this system.

## Session Structure Framework

A well-structured session typically follows this pattern:

| Phase | Duration | Purpose | Game Types |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Warm-up** | 10-15 min | Prepare body and mind | Light movement, touch games |
| **Skill Focus** | 20-30 min | Develop specific skills | Skill isolation, development games |
| **Integration** | 15-20 min | Apply skills under pressure | Combined games, positional sparring |
| **Cool-down** | 5-10 min | Recovery and reflection | Light movement, discussion |

## Planning Principles

### 1. Prerequisite Awareness

Before running a game, ensure athletes have experience with its prerequisites:

- Check the game's frontmatter for prerequisite concepts and games
- If athletes lack prerequisites, address those first
- Simpler games prepare athletes for complex ones

### 2. Progression Within Sessions

Build complexity throughout the session:

- Start with simpler constraints
- Add complexity as athletes demonstrate understanding
- End with integration or combined games

### 3. Role Balance

Ensure athletes experience both sides:

- In asymmetric games, switch roles regularly
- Track total time in each role
- Some athletes need more time in specific roles

### 4. Energy Management

Match game intensity to session goals:

- **High intensity:** Shorter rounds, more rest
- **Skill development:** Moderate intensity, focus on quality
- **Volume work:** Lower intensity, more repetitions

## Common Session Mistakes

!!! warning "Avoid These Pitfalls"

    - **Too much variety** — Better to develop one skill deeply than touch many superficially
    - **Skipping prerequisites** — Complex games fail without foundational skills
    - **Unbalanced roles** — Athletes need time on both sides
    - **No integration** — Skills need to be applied under realistic pressure
    - **Ignoring fatigue** — Quality degrades when athletes are exhausted

---

## Adapting to Athlete Level

### Beginners

- Focus on skill isolation games
- Shorter rounds, more instruction
- Emphasize correct execution over success rate
- Build vocabulary and concepts

### Intermediate

- Mix isolation and development games
- Progress through game levels within sessions
- Introduce combined games
- Expect higher quality execution

### Advanced

- Focus on integration and combined games
- Work on nuances and timing
- Introduce game modifications
- Allow more athlete autonomy
