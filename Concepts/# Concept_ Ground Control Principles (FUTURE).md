# CONCEPT: Ground Control Principles (FUTURE)

## STATUS: Placeholder for Future Development

This concept will be developed when the system expands to ground games. The following principles have been established as the foundation.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### Bottom Player (Defensive / Escaping)

**Primary Goal:** Stand back up or reverse position

**Key Principles:**
1. **Multiple points of contact** — Feet and hands, or shins and hands, connected to opponent
2. **Legs in front** — Having legs connected to opponent, ideally on the inside
3. **Leg involvement** — Legs activated around opponent's leg or body allows leverage to manipulate their movement
4. **Legs connected = control** — Wrapping legs around body or legs creates defensive structure

**Summary:** Legs in front of opponent is always better than not.

### Top Player (Offensive / Pinning)

**Primary Goal:** Maintain control, advance position, finish (TKO Pin or submission)

**Key Principles:**
1. **Get past the legs** — Opponent's legs not connected to you is always beneficial
2. **Pin hips and shoulders** — Core of pinning control
3. **Deny opponent's tools** — Don't allow them to put hands on you (frames)
4. **Isolate limbs** — Control their ability to post or escape
5. **Make body connections** — Head and shoulder control, or close to limb bases
6. **Submission positioning** — Get as close to a limb base as possible (shoulder or hip)

**Summary:** Past the legs, hips and shoulders pinned, limbs isolated.

## POSITIONAL HIERARCHY (To Be Developed)

Will map ground positions from MMA perspective:
- Back control (highest control)
- Mount
- Side control / Pin
- Half-guard
- Guard (legs connected)
- Turtle
- Open/scramble

**Note:** Hierarchy evaluated from MMA lens (TKO potential, stand-up prevention) not pure submission grappling.

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

This concept is a placeholder. It will be fully developed when ground games are added to the system. The principles above were established during system planning and should be validated before game development.
