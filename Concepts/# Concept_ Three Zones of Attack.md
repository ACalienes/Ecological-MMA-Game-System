# CONCEPT: Three Zones of Attack

## CORE PRINCIPLE

In MMA striking, there are only **three zones** you can attack:

| Zone | Targets |
|------|---------|
| Head | Chin, temple, nose, ear |
| Body | Liver, solar plexus, ribs, floating ribs |
| Legs | Thigh (inside/outside), calf, knee |

Every strike you throw targets one of these three zones. Every defense you make protects one or more of these zones.

## THE MISDIRECTION PRINCIPLE

**"Hit them where they're not."**

This is the fundamental offensive principle in striking. Your opponent can only actively defend one area at a time. When they commit their attention and guard to one zone, other zones become available.

### How It Works

1. **Threaten one zone** — Make them believe an attack is coming to Zone A
2. **They respond** — Their guard, attention, or body position shifts to protect Zone A
3. **Attack another zone** — Zone B or C is now more exposed
4. **Land the target** — Strike where their defense isn't

This isn't a trick or a gimmick — it's the fundamental reality of striking. You cannot fully protect everything at once. The attacker's job is to make the defender commit to protecting the wrong thing.

### Zone Exposure Reality

When defense commits to one zone, others open:

| If They Protect... | What Opens... |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Head (guard high, hands up) | Body and legs |
| Body (guard low, elbows tight) | Head |
| Legs (checking kicks, weight shifted) | Head and body |

## GUARD POSITION AND ZONE PROTECTION

Your hands can only be in one place at a time. Where you position your guard determines what you can protect quickly and what remains exposed.

### Common Guard Positions

**High Guard (hands at temples/forehead)**
- Protects: Head from hooks, straight punches
- Exposes: Body is open, legs are open
- Common use: When expecting head attacks, shelling up

**Mid Guard (hands at chin level)**
- Protects: Head (with small movement), can drop to body
- Exposes: Requires movement to protect anything — nothing fully covered
- Common use: Neutral stance, ready position

**Low Guard (hands at chest/belly)**
- Protects: Body and solar plexus
- Exposes: Head is completely open
- Common use: Against body punchers, baiting head shots

**Extended Guard (hands reaching out)**
- Protects: Nothing directly — hands are away from body
- Purpose: Intercept strikes before they arrive, control range, disrupt opponent
- Risk: If opponent gets past the hands, everything is exposed

**Philly Shell / Shoulder Roll**
- Protects: Lead side of head and body (using shoulder and rear hand)
- Exposes: Rear side of head, body if shoulder rolls late, legs
- Common use: Counter-punching style

### The Trade-off Reality

There is no guard position that protects all three zones. Every stance, every hand position is a choice about what to prioritize and what to leave more vulnerable.

When you see an opponent's guard, you're seeing their priorities — and their holes.

## BUILDING COMBINATIONS ACROSS ZONES

The most effective combinations don't just throw multiple strikes — they use strikes to one zone to create openings in another zone.

### The Logic

When you attack a zone, the defender responds. That response changes what's available:

| When You Attack... | Defender Tends To... | Which Opens... |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Head | Bring hands up, tuck chin | Body, legs |
| Body | Drop elbows, hunch forward | Head |
| Legs | Check or shift weight | Head and body (hands occupied with balance) |

### Combination Examples

**Jab → Cross → Left Hook to Body**
- Jab and cross attack the head
- Defender's guard rises to protect head
- Body is now exposed
- Left hook lands to open body

**Jab to Body → Cross to Head**
- Jab attacks the body
- Defender's guard drops or elbows tuck
- Head is now exposed
- Cross lands high

**1-2 → Low Kick**
- Jab-cross attacks head
- Defender's hands are occupied high
- Legs are exposed
- Low kick lands while they're focused on hands

**Head Kick Feint → Low Kick**
- Feint high kick threatens head
- Defender's hands rise, weight shifts to check high
- Lead leg is now available
- Low kick lands to exposed leg

### The Principle

Early strikes in a combination aren't just trying to land — they're **shaping the defender's response** to open the target you actually want to hit.

The last strike in a well-constructed combination is often the one that was planned from the beginning. Everything before it was setup.

## FOUND OPENINGS VS. CREATED OPENINGS

Openings exist in two ways:

### Found Openings

These exist because of the opponent's habits or current position:
- Their guard naturally sits low (head is open)
- They always drop their hands after throwing
- They don't check leg kicks
- They have a habit of looking away at certain moments

**Attacker's job:** Observe, recognize the pattern, attack the available zone.

### Created Openings

These don't exist until you make them:
- Feint to head → they react → body opens
- Attack body repeatedly → they start protecting body → head opens
- Threaten the lead leg → they shift weight → rear leg is planted (can't check)

**Attacker's job:** Use misdirection to force a defensive response that creates the opening you want.

High-level striking is about **creating** openings, not just finding them. You make the hole, then you hit it.

---

## DEFENSIVE IMPLICATIONS

### Zone Awareness

As a defender, you must be aware:
- Which zone is your guard currently protecting?
- Which zones are you exposing?
- What patterns are you showing? (Do you always protect the same zone?)

### The Defensive Problem

You cannot protect all three zones simultaneously. Defense requires:

1. **Reading** — What zone are they likely to attack?
2. **Prioritizing** — Protect the most threatened zone
3. **Recovering** — After defending one zone, reset before they attack another
4. **Varying** — Don't be predictable about which zone you prioritize

### Don't Be Predictable

If you always protect your head and leave your body open, the attacker will figure this out and target your body. Effective defense requires varying your guard position and not showing consistent patterns.

## APPLICATION TO CONFIDENCE RATING

Zone reading connects directly to the Confidence Rating concept:

| Confidence Level | Zone Strategy |
|------------------|---------------|
| Low | Probe all three zones to see how they react |
| Building | Identify which zone they protect most, which they neglect |
| High | Attack neglected zone with commitment |
| Very High | Create openings by manipulating their zone defense |

At low confidence, you're gathering information: "What happens when I go to the body? How do they react to head feints?"

At high confidence, you KNOW: "They always protect the head. Body is open. I'm going there."

---

## SUMMARY

**Three Zones:** Head, Body, Legs — these are the only targets.

**The Misdirection Principle:** "Hit them where they're not." Make them commit to defending one zone, attack another.

**Guard Reality:** Every guard position protects some zones and exposes others. There is no perfect defense.

**Combination Logic:** Use early strikes to shape defensive response and open the zone you actually want to hit.

**Found vs. Created:** Openings can be observed (their habits) or manufactured (your setups). High-level striking creates openings.

## RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CONCEPTS

| Concept | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| Confidence Rating | Zone reading is how you build offensive confidence |
| Defensive Solutions | Each solution (block, parry, slip) works differently across zones |

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

This concept may be refined as striking game patterns develop.
