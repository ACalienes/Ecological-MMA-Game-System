# GAME: Wall Control — Establish the Pin

## GAME IDENTITY
- Problem: Immobilizing opponent against the wall
- Environment: Wall
- Stage: Stabilize

This game teaches **vertical control**. Once clinch has been established at the boundary, the attacker must learn to convert connection into meaningful immobilization. The wall becomes the dominant constraint — it limits the defender's options and creates opportunities for control.

---

## GOAL

This is an **asymmetric game** focused on control establishment.

- Attacker: Establish a functional wall pin (hips and shoulders controlled, rotation denied)
- Defender: Prevent pin establishment or disengage before being flattened

The objective is **stabilization**, not damage or advancement.

---

## ENTRY CONDITION
- Start from clinch with defender positioned between attacker and wall
- Distance: 1–2 feet from wall
- Attacker has initial connection but not yet established control
- Reset if defender creates significant space or fully disengages

---

## INVARIANTS
1. Wall is dominant constraint — all control is relative to it
2. No immediate takedowns — stabilize before advancing
3. Defender actively resists — no passive drilling

---

## TASK FOCUS

### Attacker
- Control spine alignment (prevent rotation)
- Manage hips and shoulders as a unit
- Maintain own balance and posture
- Use wall as a third point of control

### Defender
- Rotate shoulders early — before being flattened
- Create frames to maintain structure
- Use hips to generate space
- Escape before position consolidates

Key internal questions:
- "Are their shoulders flat to the wall, or can they still rotate?"
- "Am I controlling their hips, or just their upper body?"
- "Do I have balance, or am I leaning into them?"

---

## LEGAL ACTIONS
- Strikes: Light strikes permitted (informational)
- Submissions: DNS allowed defensively (punishes poor posture)
- Wrestling: Clinch control, underhooks, overhooks, body locks

Strikes should reveal control quality — if the attacker cannot strike without losing position, control is incomplete.

---

## KEY LOGIC (GAME-SPECIFIC)

### What Constitutes a Pin?

A functional wall pin exists when:
- Defender's shoulders are substantially flat to wall
- Defender's hips are controlled or compromised
- Defender cannot rotate freely
- Attacker maintains structure and balance

A pin is **not** just pressing someone against the wall. It requires **organized control**.

### The Rotation Problem

The primary escape mechanism is **shoulder rotation**. If the defender can turn their shoulders, they can:
- Create frames
- Generate hip movement
- Threaten reversals
- Access escape angles

The attacker's primary task is **denying rotation** while maintaining their own balance.

### DNS as Defensive Pressure

Defensive Neck Submissions (guillotine threats, front headlock entries) are permitted for the defender. This punishes:
- Poor posture from the attacker
- Over-commitment to control
- Head position errors

DNS keeps the attacker honest without changing the game's focus.

---

## WIN CONDITIONS
- Attacker wins by holding functional pin for 5 seconds
- Defender wins by disengaging (creating space) or reversing position

5-second hold requirement ensures the pin is stable, not momentary.

---

## LEVELS

### Level 1 — Establish Pin
- Focus on achieving flat shoulders and hip control
- No strikes
- Defender resists but does not counter-attack

### Level 2 — Deny Rotation
- Defender actively works rotation escapes
- Attacker must adjust and re-pin
- Light strikes permitted

### Level 3 — Threaten TKO Pin Access
- Attacker may briefly release one control point to simulate strike access
- Pin must be re-established after strike threat
- Introduces trade-off between control and damage

## ADVANCED EXPRESSIONS (COACH CONTEXT)

As athletes develop, the wall pin reveals its strategic depth:

**For attackers:**
- Pin becomes a platform, not an endpoint
- Control becomes dynamic — adjustments without losing position
- Strike threats emerge from stable control
- TKO pin access becomes available at Level 3+

**For defenders:**
- Early rotation becomes instinctive
- Frames become structural rather than desperate
- DNS threats become genuine tactical options
- Escape timing improves — act before consolidation

At advanced levels, the 5-second hold becomes less relevant — athletes recognize stable vs unstable control intuitively.

---

## SAFETY
- Contact limits: Light strikes only; control should be firm but not crushing
- Stop conditions: Any slam attempt, loss of balance, or neck crank
- Coach intervention: Reset if pin becomes static grinding without learning value

---

## SYSTEM POSITION

Where does this game sit in the overall system?

- Prerequisite games: Winning the Circle — Boundary Trigger
- Follow-on games: Wall Escape — Anti-Pin, Wall Pin → Ground Control
- Related concepts: TKO Pin, Defensive Neck Submissions (DNS)

This is the **first true grappling control game** in the system. It establishes the principle that control must be organized before exploitation.

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

Pin definitions may evolve as control models refine.
