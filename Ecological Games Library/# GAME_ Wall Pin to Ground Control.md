# GAME: Wall Pin → Ground Control

## GAME IDENTITY
- Problem: Converting vertical control to horizontal control
- Environment: Wall → Ground
- Stage: Stabilize → Exploit

This game teaches the **transition from standing wall control to ground control**. It is the first game where the ground becomes the dominant environment. The wall serves as a launch point — once control is established vertically, the attacker learns to bring the fight down while maintaining organized control.

---

## GOAL

This is an **asymmetric game** focused on positional transition.

- Attacker: Bring opponent to ground safely and establish hip/shoulder control
- Defender: Scramble during descent, use wall to stand, or exploit sloppy transitions

The objective is **controlled transition**, not the takedown itself.

---

## ENTRY CONDITION
- Start from established wall pin (attacker has control)
- Defender's escape options are limited
- Attacker initiates transition to ground
- Reset if defender fully escapes to standing or attacker loses control completely

---

## INVARIANTS
1. No dumping bodyweight — control precedes gravity
2. Off-balancing precedes descent — takedown is created, not forced
3. Scrambles are allowed and expected

---

## TASK FOCUS

### Attacker
- Destabilize defender's base progressively
- Maintain connection through the descent
- Follow opponent to ground with balance and posture
- Anticipate and cut off scramble attempts
- Establish hip and shoulder control on ground

### Defender
- Post early — prevent uncontrolled descent
- Use wall to assist stand-up attempts
- Exploit sloppy posture (DNS opportunities)
- Scramble aggressively during transition
- Deny control establishment on ground

Key internal questions:
- "Am I controlling their descent, or just pulling them down?"
- "If they scramble, can I follow and maintain control?"
- "Is my head safe, or am I vulnerable to DNS?"
- "Can I use the wall to recover standing position?"

---

## LEGAL ACTIONS
- Strikes: Light strikes permitted
- Submissions: DNS allowed defensively (critical defensive tool)
- Wrestling: Takedowns, trips, drags; scrambles; wall-assisted stand-ups

This is the first game where wrestling actions are central to the problem.

## KEY LOGIC (GAME-SPECIFIC)

### Controlled Descent vs Dumping

**Controlled descent:**
- Attacker maintains connection throughout
- Base is compromised before gravity is applied
- Attacker lands in position to control

**Dumping:**
- Attacker uses bodyweight or momentum to force descent
- Control is lost during transition
- Scramble advantage shifts to defender

The game explicitly rewards controlled descent and punishes dumping through scramble outcomes.

### The Scramble Window

The transition from wall to ground creates a **scramble window** — a period where control is contested. During this window:
- Both athletes have opportunities
- Posture and balance determine outcomes
- DNS threats are most dangerous

Athletes learn to **shorten the scramble window** (attackers) or **exploit it** (defenders).

### Ground Control Criteria

Ground control is established when:
- Attacker controls defender's hips and shoulders
- Defender cannot easily stand or reverse
- Position is stable for 2–3 seconds

This is a lower threshold than TKO pin — it represents **control**, not **dominance**.

---

## WIN CONDITIONS
- Attacker wins with controlled hip and shoulder control on ground (2–3 seconds)
- Defender wins by scramble (return to neutral), stand-up (using wall), or reversal

Short hold requirement reflects the transitional nature of the position.

---

## LEVELS

### Level 1 — Controlled Descent
- Focus on bringing opponent to ground safely
- No strikes
- Success = descent with maintained connection

### Level 2 — Deny Scramble
- Defender actively scrambles during descent
- Attacker must follow and establish control
- Success = control despite scramble attempt

### Level 3 — Establish TKO Pin Threat
- After ground control, attacker works toward TKO pin access
- Strike threats become available
- Introduces the exploitation layer

---

## ADVANCED EXPRESSIONS (COACH CONTEXT)

As athletes develop, the wall-to-ground transition becomes fluid:

**For attackers:**
- Descent timing becomes intuitive
- Scramble anticipation improves
- Control on ground emerges immediately from transition
- TKO pin access becomes available directly from descent

**For defenders:**
- Scramble timing becomes precise
- Wall-assisted recovery becomes instinctive
- DNS threats become tactical rather than desperate
- Early posting prevents uncontrolled descent entirely

At advanced levels, the game reveals whether an athlete can **maintain control through domain changes** — a critical MMA skill.

---

## SAFETY
- Contact limits: Light strikes; no slamming or dumping bodyweight
- Stop conditions: Any slam, falling onto legs, or loss of control during descent
- Coach intervention: Reset if descent becomes uncontrolled or if either athlete's safety is compromised

**Safety is paramount in this game.** The principle "control precedes gravity" is non-negotiable.

---

## SYSTEM POSITION

Where does this game sit in the overall system?

- Prerequisite games: Wall Control — Establish the Pin
- Follow-on games: Wall Stand-Up & Re-Pin Loop
- Related concepts: TKO Pin, Defensive Neck Submissions (DNS), Scramble

This is the **first environment transition game** in the system. It teaches that control must be maintained across domain changes.

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

Descent mechanics may evolve for safety or realism.
