# GAME: Parry the Straight

## GAME IDENTITY
- Problem: Learning to parry straight punches
- Environment: Open Space
- Stage: Access (Defensive Skill Isolation)

This is a **beginner skill isolation game** that teaches the parrying defensive solution. It is the most constrained striking defense game in the system — the defender can ONLY parry, forcing them to develop this specific skill.

---

## GOAL

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

- Attacker: Land straight punches (jab or cross) to the defender's head or belly
- Defender: Parry (deflect) punches using hands or forearms

The objective is **skill development**, not competition.

---

## ENTRY CONDITION
- Both players start in neutral standing position
- Close quarters distance (striking range)
- Roles are assigned; switch after 4 minutes
- Reset to neutral after each exchange

---

## INVARIANTS
1. Attacker throws straight punches ONLY (no hooks, uppercuts, or looping strikes)
2. Defender can ONLY parry — no blocking, dodging, or backing up continuously
3. Attacker allows reset between strikes (no continuous pressure at Level 1)

---

## TASK FOCUS

### Attacker
- Land clean straight punches to head or body
- Vary targets (head vs belly) to challenge defender
- Single strikes are easier for defender — diversify to increase difficulty
- Incorporate feints at higher levels to disrupt timing

### Defender
- Keep hands close to face as base position
- Tap straight punches to the left or right to redirect them
- Use hands or forearms to deflect
- Read the punch early — parry before it lands, not after

Key internal questions:
- "Am I redirecting the punch or just getting hit?"
- "Can I see the punch coming early enough to parry?"
- "Am I resetting to a good defensive position after each parry?"

---

## LEGAL ACTIONS
- Strikes: Straight punches only (jab, cross) — attacker only
- Submissions: None
- Wrestling: None

Defender cannot strike, clinch, dodge, block, or back up continuously.

---

## KEY LOGIC (GAME-SPECIFIC)

### Why Isolate Parrying?

Parrying is one of four core defensive solutions. By constraining the defender to parrying only, they must:
- Develop the timing and hand-eye coordination for parries
- Learn to read straight punches
- Build the habit of redirecting rather than absorbing

### Parrying Mechanics

- You can only parry **straight strikes**, not looping strikes
- Less distance = harder to parry, easier to tight block
- Successful parry redirects the punch off your centerline

### Diagnostic Nature

This game has no winner. Success is measured by:
- Quality of parries (clean deflection vs getting hit)
- Timing improvement
- Reduced flinching

---

## WIN CONDITIONS

**Defender wins by:** Successfully parrying a punch cleanly (full deflection)

**Attacker wins by:** Landing a clean punch to the head or body

**On defender win:** Roles switch — defender becomes attacker.

**On attacker win:** Reset to neutral, same roles, attacker continues.

### The Strategic Insight

You don't need to parry every punch. The defender can absorb strikes while reading the attacker's pattern and timing. When confidence is high, commit to the parry. This teaches:

- **Pattern recognition** before commitment
- **Parrying as opportunity**, not just survival
- **Timing over volume** — one good parry beats ten bad ones

Duration: Play until natural stopping point or time limit. Role switches keep both players engaged.

---

## LEVELS

### Level 1 — Single Punch, Fixed Tempo
- One straight punch at a time
- 1-second reset between punches
- No feints
- Defender: parry only

### Level 2 — Variable Tempo
- Still single punches
- No reset requirement — attacker varies timing
- Defender must read rhythm, not just react

### Level 3 — Add Feints
- Attacker can feint before throwing
- Defender must distinguish real from fake
- Parrying a feint = wasted movement

### Level 4 — Two-Punch Combinations
- Attacker throws 2-punch combos (jab-cross, jab-body, etc.)
- Still straight punches only
- Defender must parry both or recover quickly

### Level 5 — Counter After Parry
- After a successful parry, defender can throw one counter punch
- Keeps parrying central but adds offensive response
- Teaches parry as setup, not just survival

---

## ADVANCED EXPRESSIONS (COACH CONTEXT)

As athletes develop:

**For defenders:**
- Parries become smaller and more efficient
- Timing becomes anticipatory rather than reactive
- Counter opportunities emerge naturally after parry
- Hand position becomes optimized for both defense and counter

**For attackers:**
- Learn what makes punches hard to parry (timing variation, level changes)
- Develop feinting skills
- Understand how to set up combinations

This game builds the **parrying foundation** that transfers to open striking games.

---

## SAFETY
- Contact limits: Light to moderate — punches should land if not parried, but not at full power
- Stop conditions: Any loss of composure or excessive force
- Coach intervention: Reset if defender starts blocking/dodging instead of parrying

---

## SYSTEM POSITION

Where does this game sit in the overall system?

- Prerequisite games: None — this is a foundational game
- Follow-on games: Close-Range Defense, Touch and Don't Get Touched
- Related concepts: Defensive Solutions in Striking (Parrying)

This is the **first defensive skill isolation game** in the system. Parallel games exist for blocking and dodging.

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

This game may be refined as defensive skill development patterns emerge.
