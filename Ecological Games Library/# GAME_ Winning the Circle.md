# GAME: Winning the Circle

## GAME IDENTITY
- Problem: Space domination and engagement denial
- Environment: Open Space
- Stage: Access

This is the **primary space-control game** in the system. It teaches athletes to manage distance through movement and pressure rather than through blocking or absorbing strikes. The circle creates a clear spatial problem that forces intelligent footwork.

---

## GOAL

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

- Outside Player (Attacker): Apply pressure to control space and limit escape routes
- Inside Player (Defender): Maintain access to open space and avoid being crowded or cornered

The objective is **spatial control**, not damage accumulation.

---

## ENTRY CONDITION
- Both players start in open space
- A visible or imagined circular boundary exists (training ring, tape, cones)
- Roles are assigned and may switch between rounds
- Reset to neutral distance after each boundary violation

---

## INVARIANTS
1. No clinching
2. No takedowns
3. Movement is continuous — static exchanges reset

---

## TASK FOCUS

### Outside Player (Attacker)
- Apply intelligent forward pressure
- Use footwork, feints, and probing strikes
- Corral opponent toward boundary
- Cut off lateral escape routes

### Inside Player (Defender)
- Maintain space through movement
- Avoid being crowded or flattened against boundary
- Minimize need for physical blocking by positional accuracy
- Recognize when space is shrinking

Key internal questions:
- "Am I controlling the center or being pushed to the edge?"
- "Can I escape laterally, or are my routes being cut?"
- "Is my pressure creating reactions, or am I just chasing?"

---

## LEGAL ACTIONS
- Strikes: Light punches and kicks allowed
- Submissions: None
- Wrestling: None

No flurries (max 2–3 strike sequences). Strikes are informational — they measure distance and create reactions, not damage.

---

## KEY LOGIC (GAME-SPECIFIC)

### Pressure vs Chasing

Effective pressure **limits options**. Chasing **follows the opponent**.

Signs of chasing:
- Lunging forward without cutting angles
- Reacting to movement instead of anticipating it
- Losing balance or posture during pursuit

Signs of pressure:
- Opponent's movement becomes predictable
- Escape routes visibly shrink
- Attacker maintains composure and structure

The game rewards **intelligent pressure** and punishes **mindless aggression**.

---

## WIN CONDITIONS
- Attacker wins if defender steps out of the circle (boundary violation)
- Defender wins if time expires without boundary violation

Typical round length: 60–90 seconds.

---

## LEVELS

### Level 1 — Movement Only
- No strikes
- Pure footwork and spatial awareness
- Focus on angles, not speed

### Level 2 — Add Light Strikes
- Punches and kicks permitted
- Strikes used to create movement, not damage
- Defender learns to move without flinching

### Level 3 — Feints and Stance Manipulation
- Feints count as pressure tools
- Stance switches and level changes permitted
- Attacker learns to create false reads

---

## ADVANCED EXPRESSIONS (COACH CONTEXT)

As athletes develop, the game reveals deeper layers:

**For attackers:**
- Pressure becomes rhythmic rather than constant
- Feints create more movement than real strikes
- Cutting angles becomes instinctive

**For defenders:**
- Movement becomes smaller and more efficient
- Circling transitions to pivoting
- Counter-striking opportunities emerge naturally

At advanced levels, the boundary becomes less relevant — the athlete has internalized spatial awareness. The game can then transition to open sparring with spatial goals.

---

## SAFETY
- Contact limits: Touch or light strikes only
- Stop conditions: Any loss of control, chasing collisions, or boundary disputes
- Coach intervention: Reset if exchanges become static or if pressure degrades into aggression
