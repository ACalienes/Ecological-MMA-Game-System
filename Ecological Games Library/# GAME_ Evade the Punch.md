# GAME: Evade the Punch

## GAME IDENTITY
- Problem: Learning to evade different punch types using appropriate head movement
- Environment: Open Space
- Stage: Access (Defensive Skill Integration)

This is an **intermediate skill integration game** that teaches punch-type recognition and appropriate evasion selection. The defender must read whether a punch is straight or hooking and apply the correct evasive movement.

---

## GOAL

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

- Attacker (Offense): Land punches (straights and hooks) to defender's head
- Defender: Evade punches using appropriate head movement (slip straights, duck hooks)

The objective is **skill integration** — matching the defensive solution to the attack.

---

## ENTRY CONDITION
- Both players start in neutral standing position
- Close quarters distance (striking range)
- Roles are assigned; switch after 4 minutes
- Reset to neutral after each exchange

---

## INVARIANTS
1. Attacker throws straights and/or hooks (scaled to level)
2. Defender can ONLY evade — no blocking, parrying, or backing up continuously
3. Attacker throws head strikes only
4. Attacker allows reset between strikes (no continuous pressure at Level 1)

---

## TASK FOCUS

### Attacker
- Land clean punches to the head
- Mix straight and hooking punches to force recognition
- Vary timing and rhythm

### Defender
- **Slip** straights (head moves laterally offline)
- **Duck/Bob** hooks (head moves down/under the arc)
- Read punch type early and select appropriate response

Key internal questions:
- "Am I reading the punch type early enough?"
- "Am I using the right evasion for this punch?"
- "Is the punch fully missing or grazing me?"

---

## LEGAL ACTIONS
- Strikes: Attacker only — straights and hooks to head
- Submissions: None
- Wrestling: None

Defender cannot strike back, cannot clinch, cannot exit.

---

## KEY LOGIC (GAME-SPECIFIC)

### The Core Skill: Matching Evasion to Punch Type

Different punches require different evasive movements:

| Punch Type | Evasion | Why |
|------------|---------|-----|
| Jab/Cross | **Slip** (lateral) | Straight punches travel down centerline |
| Hook | **Duck/Bob** (vertical) | Hooks follow lateral head movement |

Using the wrong evasion gets you hit.

### Slip vs. Duck

| Evasion | Movement | Works For | Fails Against |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Slip | Head moves left/right | Straights | Hooks (follows you) |
| Duck/Bob | Head moves down/under | Hooks | Uppercuts (meets you) |

### The Recognition Challenge

The defender must read the punch early enough to select the correct evasion:
- **Arm stays straight** → Slip
- **Elbow bends, arm arcs** → Duck

This is the key perceptual skill being developed.

---

## WIN CONDITIONS

**Defender wins by:** Successfully evading a punch with correct technique (slip a straight OR duck a hook)

**Attacker wins by:** Landing a clean punch to the head

**On defender win:** Roles switch — defender becomes attacker.

**On attacker win:** Reset to neutral, same roles, attacker continues.

### The Strategic Insight

You don't need to evade every punch. The defender can absorb strikes while reading the attacker's patterns — identifying whether straights or hooks are coming. When confidence is high, commit to the correct evasion. This teaches:

- **Punch recognition** before commitment
- **Evasion selection** under pressure
- **Timing over volume** — one correct evasion beats ten wrong ones

Duration: Play until natural stopping point or time limit. Role switches keep both players engaged.

---

## LEVELS

### Level 1 — Predictable Pattern
- Attacker alternates: straight, hook, straight, hook
- Defender knows what's coming
- Focus: Correct evasion mechanics for each type

### Level 2 — Random Selection
- Attacker throws straights OR hooks randomly
- Single punches, with reset between
- Focus: Recognition and selection

### Level 3 — Variable Tempo
- Random punch selection
- No fixed reset — attacker varies timing
- Focus: Staying ready for either type

### Level 4 — Add Feints
- Attacker can feint before throwing
- Feinting a jab then throwing a hook is now possible
- Focus: Patience and commitment timing

### Level 5 — Two-Punch Combinations
- Attacker throws 2-punch combinations
- May mix straights and hooks in same combo
- Focus: Chaining evasions together

## ADVANCED EXPRESSIONS (COACH CONTEXT)

As athletes develop:

**For defenders:**
- Punch recognition becomes instant and automatic
- Evasion selection happens without conscious thought
- Recovery between evasions becomes fluid

**For attackers:**
- Learn to disguise punch type longer
- Develop combinations that exploit evasion patterns
- Understand how to catch defenders between movements

---

## SAFETY
- Contact limits: Light to moderate — punches should land if not evaded, but not full power
- Stop conditions: Loss of composure, freezing, excessive force
- Coach intervention: Reset if defender starts blocking instead of evading

**Hook Caution:** Hooks carry more rotational force. Attackers should throw at controlled speed until defender demonstrates recognition skill.

---

## SYSTEM POSITION

Where does this game sit in the overall system?

- Prerequisite games: Slip the Straight (recommended)
- Follow-on games: Close-Range Defense
- Related concepts: Defensive Solutions in Striking (Evasion)

This is a **skill integration game** that bridges single-skill isolation and full defensive mixing.

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

This game may be refined as defensive skill development patterns emerge.
