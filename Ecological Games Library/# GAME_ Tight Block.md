# GAME: Tight Block

## GAME IDENTITY
- Problem: Learning to absorb strikes using a tight guard/shell
- Environment: Open Space
- Stage: Access (Defensive Skill Isolation)

This is a **beginner skill isolation game** that teaches the blocking defensive solution. The defender can ONLY block using a tight shell, forcing them to develop this foundational skill.

---

## GOAL

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

- Attacker (Offense): Land punches (straights and hooks) to defender's head or body
- Defender: Block punches using tight guard (shell up, elbows in, hands protecting head)

The objective is **skill development**, not competition.

---

## ENTRY CONDITION
- Both players start in neutral standing position
- Close quarters distance (striking range)
- Roles are assigned; switch after 4 minutes
- Reset to neutral after each exchange

---

## INVARIANTS
1. Attacker throws straights and/or hooks (scaled to level)
2. Defender can ONLY block — no parrying, dodging, or backing up continuously
3. Attacker allows reset between strikes (no continuous pressure at Level 1)

---

## TASK FOCUS

### Attacker
- Land clean punches to head or body
- Vary targets and punch types to challenge defender
- Scale difficulty based on defender success

### Defender
- Maintain tight guard position (hands to face, elbows protecting body)
- Absorb strikes on arms and gloves, not on exposed targets
- Reset to good position after each defensive sequence

Key internal questions:
- "Is my guard tight enough to protect my head?"
- "Are my elbows covering my body?"
- "Am I absorbing on my arms or getting hit clean?"

---

## LEGAL ACTIONS
- Strikes: Attacker only — straights and hooks, scaled to level
- Submissions: None
- Wrestling: None

Defender cannot strike back, cannot clinch, cannot exit.

---

## KEY LOGIC (GAME-SPECIFIC)

### Why Isolate Blocking?

Blocking is the most fundamental defensive solution. By constraining the defender to blocking only:
- Develops the habit of shelling up under pressure
- Learns to absorb on arms/gloves rather than exposed targets
- Builds composure when taking fire

### Blocking Mechanics
- Tight guard = Hands to face, elbows to body, chin tucked
- Works for BOTH straights and hooks (unlike parrying or slipping)
- Trade-off: Maximum protection, but no counter opportunity and hands are occupied

### Why Blocking Differs from Parrying

| Aspect | Blocking | Parrying |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Strike types | Straights AND hooks | Straights only |
| Movement | Static/absorbing | Active/redirecting |
| Energy | Absorbs impact | Deflects impact |
| Counter setup | Minimal | Creates opening |

---

## WIN CONDITIONS

**FLAGGED FOR REVIEW:** Win conditions for blocking games require different logic than parrying/slipping games. Blocking is survival-oriented rather than opportunity-creating.

Possible approaches:
- Time-based: 4 minutes defensive, then switch roles (8 minute round)
- Combination-based: Absorb X combinations without getting hit clean
- Accumulation: First to land Y clean strikes wins

Needs further development to determine best gamification approach.

**Current structure:** 4 minutes per role, then switch. Success evaluated by percentage of strikes absorbed on guard.

---

## LEVELS

### Level 1 — Single Punches, Straights Only
- One straight punch at a time
- 1-second reset between punches
- Defender: tight block only

### Level 2 — Add Hooks
- Attacker can throw straights OR hooks
- Defender adjusts guard for different angles
- Focus: Covering multiple attack lines

### Level 3 — Variable Tempo
- Attacker varies timing between strikes
- No fixed reset requirement
- Defender must stay ready

### Level 4 — Two-Punch Combinations
- Attacker throws 2-punch combos
- Mix of straights and hooks
- Defender absorbs combinations

### Level 5 — Longer Combinations
- Attacker throws 3-4 punch combinations
- Defender maintains guard through extended pressure
- Focus: Composure under sustained fire

---

## ADVANCED EXPRESSIONS (COACH CONTEXT)

As athletes develop:

**For defenders:**
- Guard becomes automatic under pressure
- Absorption becomes efficient (minimal energy expenditure)
- Composure remains steady through long exchanges

**For attackers:**
- Learn to test guard integrity
- Develop combination patterns that stress guard
- Understand appropriate pressure levels

---

## SAFETY
- Contact limits: Light to moderate — punches should be felt but not damaging
- Stop conditions: Loss of composure, guard breakdown, excessive force
- Coach intervention: Reset if defender starts moving/dodging instead of blocking

---

## SYSTEM POSITION

Where does this game sit in the overall system?

- Prerequisite games: None — this is foundational
- Follow-on games: Close-Range Defense
- Related concepts: Defensive Solutions in Striking (Blocking)

This is a **skill isolation game** that develops one of the four core defensive solutions.

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

This game may be refined as defensive skill development patterns emerge.
