# GAME: Close-Range Defense

## GAME IDENTITY
- Problem: Defending strikes at close range using multiple defensive solutions
- Environment: Open Space (Close Quarters)
- Stage: Access / Counter

This is a **scaling defensive game** that progressively opens up defensive options. Unlike skill isolation games, this game teaches the defender to mix between blocking, parrying, and dodging based on what the situation demands.

---

## GOAL

This is an **asymmetric game** with distinct roles.

- Attacker (Offense): Compromise defender's openings and land strikes
- Defender: Defend strikes effectively using defensive principles (tight blocking, parrying, static dodging)

The objective is **defensive adaptability** — learning when to use which solution.

---

## ENTRY CONDITION
- Both players start in neutral standing at close quarters (inside striking range)
- Attacker in "winning position" (slight pressure advantage)
- Defender in "losing position" (must defend, cannot exit freely)
- Reset after successful defensive sequence or clean strike lands

---

## INVARIANTS
1. Defender cannot exit — must stay and defend (no backing up continuously)
2. Attacker must throw combinations and allow for reset (no continuous overwhelming pressure)
3. Attacker must strike in reasonable distance for game to play (can't crowd the defender)

---

## TASK FOCUS

### Attacker
- Compromise defender's openings and land strikes
- Start with only head strikes or only straight punches
- Increase striking levels and variety based on defender's skill
- Scale difficulty to partner — increase challenge with successful defense

### Defender
- Effectively mix between different kinds of defense as task focus opens up
- Start with only tight blocking
- Progress to tight blocking with parrying
- Add dodging at higher levels
- Advanced: Work to turn the corner on attacker and prepare for counter-attack position

**Defensive Trade-offs:**
- Hands closer to face = easier to defend significant strikes, harder to counter
- Hands further out (outstretched) = more compromised to strikes, but can preemptively disrupt attacker (hand fighting/hand control) or be in position to counter
- When dodging, more offline head position = more compromised for significant strikes and off-balancing

Key internal questions:
- "Am I using the right defensive solution for this strike?"
- "Can I see the combinations coming?"
- "Am I defending and resetting, or getting overwhelmed?"

---

## LEGAL ACTIONS
- Strikes: Attacker — combinations allowed, scaled to defender skill
- Submissions: None
- Wrestling: None

Defender cannot strike back (until advanced levels), cannot clinch, cannot exit.

## KEY LOGIC (GAME-SPECIFIC)

### Scaling Defensive Solutions

The defender's available tools open up progressively:

| Level | Blocking | Parrying | Dodging | Counter |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Yes | No | No | No |
| 2 | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| 3 | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| 4 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

This teaches the defender to **layer** defensive solutions rather than rely on one.

### Attacker Scaling

The attacker scales difficulty based on defender success:
- If defender handles current level easily → increase variety, speed, or combination length
- If defender struggles → simplify attacks until they find success

This creates a **self-regulating difficulty** system.

### The Hand Position Trade-Off

A key learning in this game:
- **Tight guard** (hands to face): Maximum protection, minimal counter opportunity
- **Extended guard** (hands out): Vulnerable to clean shots, but can disrupt and counter

Athletes learn there is no "correct" position — only trade-offs.

---

## WIN CONDITIONS

No winning condition — this is a **diagnostic game**.

Success is evaluated by:
- Defender: Percentage of strikes defended, quality of defensive selection
- Attacker: Ability to find openings, appropriate scaling

Duration: Continuous rounds, switch roles periodically.

---

## LEVELS

### Level 1 — Tight Blocking Only
- Defender can only use tight blocking (shell up)
- Attacker throws head strikes only, straight punches only
- Focus: Absorb and reset

### Level 2 — Add Parrying
- Defender can now block OR parry
- Attacker adds body strikes
- Focus: Choose appropriate defense for each strike

### Level 3 — Add Dodging
- Defender can block, parry, or dodge (static head movement)
- Attacker adds hooks and varied combinations
- Focus: Full defensive toolkit integration

### Level 4 — Add Counter Opportunity
- After successful defense, defender can throw one counter strike
- Attacker must respect the counter threat
- Focus: Defense as setup for offense

### Level 5 — Turn the Corner
- Defender can work to reposition (turn the corner on attacker)
- Creates angle for counter-attack or escape
- Focus: Defensive footwork integration

## ADVANCED EXPRESSIONS (COACH CONTEXT)

As athletes develop:

**For defenders:**
- Defensive selection becomes automatic based on range and strike type
- Movement between blocking, parrying, and dodging becomes fluid
- Counter opportunities are recognized instantly
- Position improves through defensive sequences (turning the corner)

**For attackers:**
- Learn to read defensive habits and exploit them
- Develop combination intelligence (what opens up what)
- Understand appropriate pressure vs overwhelming

At advanced levels, this game approaches light sparring with defensive focus.

---

## SAFETY
- Contact limits: Light to moderate — strikes should be felt but not damaging
- Stop conditions: Overwhelming pressure, loss of composure, excessive force
- Coach intervention: Reset if attacker is not allowing defensive opportunities

## SYSTEM POSITION

Where does this game sit in the overall system?

- Prerequisite games: Parry the Straight (and other skill isolation games)
- Follow-on games: Touch and Don't Get Touched, Winning the Circle
- Related concepts: Defensive Solutions in Striking, Hand Controls

This game **bridges** skill isolation and open striking games by combining defensive solutions.

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

This game may be refined as defensive integration patterns emerge.
