# GAME: Wall Stand-Up & Re-Pin Loop

## GAME IDENTITY
- Problem: Repeated stand-up and control cycles near the wall
- Environment: Wall / Ground (hybrid)
- Stage: Counter ↔ Stabilize

This game teaches the **cyclical nature of wall fighting**. In real MMA, positions near the wall rarely resolve in a single action — athletes cycle between ground control, stand-up attempts, and re-pinning. This game captures that loop.

---

## GOAL

This is an **asymmetric game** with cyclical dynamics.

- Defender: Stand using the wall, turn to face, and disengage or reverse
- Attacker: Prevent disengagement, re-pin, or flatten to re-establish control

The objective is **loop management** — understanding how positions cycle and where opportunities exist.

---

## ENTRY CONDITION
- Defender starts in a compromised ground position near wall (seated, turtle, or elbow-post)
- Attacker has partial control but not full pin
- Wall is accessible to defender
- Reset if defender fully disengages or attacker establishes TKO pin

---

## INVARIANTS
1. Wall access is always available to defender
2. Disengagement ends the exchange — defender wins
3. Control must be re-earned after each stand-up attempt

---

## TASK FOCUS

### Defender
- Build base toward wall progressively
- Time stand-up attempts to exploit attacker's adjustment
- Turn to face before attempting disengage
- Use DNS if attacker's posture is compromised during follow

### Attacker
- Cut off hip movement to deny stand-up
- Re-pin or flatten when defender attempts to rise
- Prevent clean disengagement
- Maintain posture to avoid DNS

Key internal questions:
- "Is their base strong enough to stand, or can I keep them down?"
- "If they stand, can I re-pin before they turn?"
- "Am I following with control, or just chasing?"
- "Is the wall helping me or helping them?"

---

## LEGAL ACTIONS
- Strikes: Light strikes permitted (informational)
- Submissions: DNS allowed defensively
- Wrestling: Stand-ups, re-pins, flattening, scrambles

Strikes reveal control quality but should not dominate the exchange.

---

## KEY LOGIC (GAME-SPECIFIC)

### The Stand-Up Cycle

The loop typically follows this pattern:
1. **Defender initiates stand-up** — builds base toward wall
2. **Attacker follows** — attempts to re-pin or flatten
3. **Position resolves** — either defender stands/disengages or attacker re-establishes control
4. **Loop repeats** — if neither achieves decisive position

Understanding this cycle is critical for both roles.

### Wall as Double-Edged Constraint

The wall helps **both** athletes:
- **Defender**: Provides structure to build base and stand
- **Attacker**: Limits defender's escape routes and provides pinning surface

The athlete who uses the wall more intelligently gains advantage.

### Turning Before Disengaging

A critical defensive principle: **turn to face before attempting to disengage**.

If defender attempts to disengage while facing away:
- Back is exposed
- Re-clinch is easy
- Striker access is dangerous

If defender turns first:
- Defensive posture is established
- Disengage becomes viable
- Counter-attack becomes available

---

## WIN CONDITIONS
- Defender wins by standing + disengaging (creating space while facing attacker) or reversing (achieving dominant position)
- Attacker wins by re-pin (re-establishing wall control), flattening (returning to ground control), or TKO pin (establishing strike-ready dominance)

Multiple win conditions reflect the cyclical nature of the position.

---

## LEVELS

### Level 1 — Stand-Up
- Focus on rising from compromised position using wall
- No strikes
- Success = standing with wall behind

### Level 2 — Stand-Up + Disengage
- Must turn to face and create space
- Attacker follows aggressively
- Success = facing attacker with space to reset

### Level 3 — Stand-Up + Reversal
- Defender attempts to achieve dominant position
- Reversal = defender now has attacker pinned
- Highest difficulty — requires reading attacker's balance and commitment

---

## ADVANCED EXPRESSIONS (COACH CONTEXT)

As athletes develop, the loop reveals strategic depth:

**For defenders:**
- Stand-up timing becomes precise — act during attacker adjustment
- Wall usage becomes efficient — minimal effort, maximum effect
- Turn-and-face becomes automatic
- Reversal opportunities emerge from attacker over-commitment

**For attackers:**
- Following becomes controlled, not desperate
- Re-pinning becomes smooth — continuous control through transitions
- Flattening becomes available when stand-up is anticipated
- TKO pin access emerges from successful re-pins

At advanced levels, athletes recognize **which part of the loop favors them** and work to stay there.

---

## SAFETY
- Contact limits: Light strikes; no grinding or cranking
- Stop conditions: Any neck crank, falling onto legs, or frustration-based escalation
- Coach intervention: Reset if loop becomes static grinding without learning value

---

## SYSTEM POSITION

Where does this game sit in the overall system?

- Prerequisite games: Wall Pin → Ground Control
- Follow-on games: Ground control games (future), TKO pin games (future)
- Related concepts: TKO Pin, Defensive Neck Submissions (DNS), Scramble

This game teaches that **positions are not static** — they cycle, and understanding the cycle creates advantage.

## SYSTEM EVOLUTION NOTICE

Loop dynamics may evolve as patterns are observed.
